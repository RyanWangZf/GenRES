    "Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users .|INTRODUCTION : The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction .|The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Three groups , comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN ) , 30 occasional cocaine ( OC ) , and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC ) users , were compared .|An emotional facial expression ( EFE ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surprise , sadness , anger , fear , and disgust ) was administered .|Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived .|Participants were also assessed with the \" Eyes task \" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology .|RESULTS : There were no group differences in psychopathology or \" eyes task \" performance , but the RC group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group , exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups .|The RC group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surprise , more slowly than CN , but not OC participants .|The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust .|The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group can not be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine , or ecstasy , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired .|Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .": [

    "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": [

    "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": [

    "Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low - risk patients with cocaine - associated chest pain .|BACKGROUND : Most patients presenting to emergency departments ( EDs ) with cocaine - associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a \" rule out acute coronary syndrome \" protocol , often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge .|In patients without cocaine use , coronary computerized tomography angiography ( CTA ) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged .|It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine - associated chest pain , as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia .|We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine - associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge .|METHODS : We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low - risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain ( self - reported or positive urine test ) .|Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED ( without serial markers ) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements .|Patients with negative coronary CTA ( maximal stenosis less than 50 % ) were discharged .|The main outcome was 30 - day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction .|RESULTS : A total of 59 patients with cocaine - associated chest pain were evaluated .|Patients had a mean age of 45 . 6 + / - 6 . 6 yrs and were 86 % black , 66 % male .|Seventy - nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85 % had a TIMI score < 2 .|Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED , 18 of whom were discharged following CTA ( 90 % ) .|Thirty - nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period , with 37 discharged home following CTA ( 95 % ) .|Six patients had coronary stenosis > or = 50 % .|During the 30 - day follow - up period , no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Although cocaine - associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction , patients with cocaine associated chest pain , a non - ischemic ECG , and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30 - day adverse events .": [

    "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": [

    "Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson 's disease : clues from dyskinetic patients .|The plasticity of primary motor cortex ( M1 ) in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs ) is severely impaired .|We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) .|This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation .|This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity , indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity .|The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known .|To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1 , we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS - induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral , real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation .|Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 .|These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function , occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it , may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements .": [

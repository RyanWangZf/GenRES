      "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

      "Operator Toll Dialing was a project and method used by the Bell System in the USA and Canada to automate the switching and billing of long distance calls in the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) .

Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices .

      "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .

Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time . \nrelations: [/INST]  Here are the relationships extracted from the given prompt:\n\n[[\"Clandestine literature\", \"also called\", \"underground literature\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"refers to\", \"editorial and publishing process\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"involves\", \"self-publishing works\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"often in contradiction with\", \"legal standards of a location\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"attempt to\", \"circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"may be referred to as\", \"heterodox publications\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"Examples include\", \"Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"Examples include\", \"Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"Examples include\", \"nushu writing of some upper-class women in Hunan, China\"],\n[\"Clandestine publications\", \"were plentiful during\", \"Enlightenment era in 18th-century France\"],\n[\"Clandestine publications\", \"circulating as\", \"pamphlets or manuscripts\"],\n[\"Clandestine publications\", \"usually containing texts that would have been considered\", \"highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime\"],\n[\"Clandestine publications\", \"contained controversial works such as\", \"Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"willingness to break the law may be due to\", \"ideological reasons\"],\n[\"Clandestine literature\", \"willingness to break the law may be due to\", \"formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works\"],\n[\"Underground literature\", \"type of\", \"clandestine literature\"],\n[\"Underground literature\", \"does not necessarily have\", \"evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose\"],\n[\"Underground literature\", \"goal of its writers may only be to\", \"lower publishing costs\"],\n[\"Works originally published by clandestine means\", \"may eventually become established as\", \"canonical literature\"],\n[\"Legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction\", \"may assist writers from elsewhere to\", \"circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad\"]]</s>",

The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland .

Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore . \nrelations: [/INST]  Here are the relationships extracted from the given prompt:\n\n[[\"Ferrous metallurgy\", \"is\", \"metallurgy of iron and its alloys\"],\n[\"Ferrous metallurgy\", \"began\", \"far back in prehistory\"],\n[\"iron\", \"was\", \"produced from iron ores\"],\n[\"wrought iron\", \"was\", \"known by\", \"1st millennium BC\"],\n[\"cast iron\", \"was\", \"produced\", \"medieval period\"],\n[\"steel\", \"was\", \"produced\", \"antiquity\"],\n[\"steel\", \"has\", \"carbon content between\", \"pig iron and wrought iron\"],\n[\"Wootz steel\", \"was\", \"exported\", \"before 4th century BC\"],\n[\"cast iron\", \"appeared\", \"5th century BC\", \"China\"],\n[\"new methods\", \"were devised\", \"17th century\"],\n[\"new methods\", \"were applied\", \"Industrial Revolution\"],\n[\"Henry Bessemer\", \"invented\", \"new steelmaking process\"],\n[\"mild steel\", \"displaced\", \"wrought iron\"],\n[\"Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB\", \"owns\", \"largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world\"]]\n\nNote: Some relationships may be implied or indirect, and some entities may have multiple relationships with other entities.</s>",

      "The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10 , 1260 , between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt , in Syria . After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260 , Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge , thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria . However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year .

However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year . \nrelations: [/INST]  Here are the relationships extracted from the prompt:\n\n[[\"Ilkhanates of Persia\", \"fought against\", \"forces of Egypt\"],\n[\"Ilkhanates of Persia\", \"historic victory\", \"Mamluk victory\"],\n[\"Hulagu Khan\", \"executed\", \"Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate armies\", \"forced out of\", \"Syria and the Levant\"],\n[\"Aleppo\", \"occupied by\", \"Mamluk occupation\"],\n[\"Damascus\", \"occupied by\", \"Mamluk occupation\"],\n[\"Homs\", \"remained in possession of\", \"minor Ayyubid princes\"],\n[\"Hama\", \"remained in possession of\", \"minor Ayyubid princes\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate\", \"sent troops\", \"6,000 troops\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate generals\", \"initiated expedition\", \"Baidu\"],\n[\"Mamluks\", \"advanced\", \"just before the battle of Ain Jalut\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate force\", \"recaptured\", \"Aleppo\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate force\", \"travelled southwards\", \"Homs\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate force\", \"defeated\", \"decisively defeated\"],\n[\"Ilkhanate\", \"several later incursions\", \"none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year\"]]</s>",

      "The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum ( ) was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia , Bulgaria , from 1949 to 1999 . The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third . The fourth ( and successful ) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive , less powerful explosions .

The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third . The fourth ( and successful ) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive , less powerful explosions . \nrelations: [/INST]  Here are the relationships extracted from the given prompt:\n\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"was located in\", \"Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"was built in\", \"1949\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"contained the body of\", \"Georgi Dimitrov\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov\", \"was the first Communist leader of\", \"Bulgaria\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov\", \"died in\", \"1949\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov's body\", \"was returned to Sofia from\", \"the USSR\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov's body\", \"was cremated and buried in\", \"Sofia's Central Cemetery\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"was destroyed by\", \"Ivan Kostov's UDF government\"]]\n[[\"Ivan Kostov's UDF government\", \"claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate because\", \"it represented Bulgaria's repressive past\"]]\n[[\"Ivan Kostov's UDF government\", \"faced opposition from within the government and the population\", \"regarding the demolition of the mausoleum\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"was proposed to be turned into a\", \"museum or art gallery\"]]\n[[\"Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum\", \"was demolished using\", \"a series of consecutive, less powerful explosions\"]]</s>",

      "Andrea Lilio ( 1555 - 1642 ) was an Italian painter born in Ancona , hence he also is known as L'Anconitano .

He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano . In the latter , he painted , Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent . Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci , Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences .

      "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .

      "Glandularia , common name mock vervain or mock verbena , is a genus of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae . They are native to the Americas .

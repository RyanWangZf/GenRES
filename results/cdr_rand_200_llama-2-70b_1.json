Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P < 0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups.\n\t* study: observes higher malondialdehyde levels in BCNU-exposed group\n\t* study: shows that melatonin decreases malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group\n\nBased on the relationships extracted, we can see that the study is focused on the effects of BCNU on the development of the offspring cerebellum and the protective effects of melatonin against these effects. The study exposed pregnant Wistar rats to BCNU and gave melatonin to some of the groups to evaluate the alterations in the offspring cerebellum. The results showed that BCNU exposure led to delayed maturation of the cerebellum, which was characterized by increased number of TUNEL and nestin positive cells, but decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin, and transforming growth factor beta1. Melatonin significantly reversed these changes, indicating its protective effects against BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia.</s>",

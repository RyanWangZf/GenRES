It plays a major role in the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension, as the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in rats with lithium-treated diabetes insipidus after DOCA-salt treatment. Administration of DDAVP, which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect, failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of AVP. The pressor action of vasopressin appears to be important in the development of this model of hypertension, as enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of hypertension. Increased secretion of vasopressin from the neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hypertension.

Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer, aging, and cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigate whether doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer. Cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV and apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed. Hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage.

Patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP (MSDBP) > or = 95 mm Hg and < 110 mm Hg) were randomized to one of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg; VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo.

Control was defined as MSDBP < 90 mm Hg compared with baseline. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry. Results: All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (VAL and HCTZ, P < 0.001). Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001). The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo. The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg compared with VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002). Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL/HCTZ combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. Efficacy and tolerability of VAL/HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients). Conclusions: In this study population, combination therapies with VAL/HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.

In the last few years, delayed reactions several hours after the injection of radiographic and contrast materials (PRC) have been described with increasing frequency. The authors report two observations on patients with delayed reactions in whom intradermoreactions (IDR) and patch tests to a series of ionic and non ionic PRC were studied. After angiography by the venous route in patient n\u00b01, a biphasic reaction with an immediate reaction (dyspnea, loss of consciousness) and delayed macro-papular rash appeared, whilst patient n\u00b02 developed a generalised sensation of heat, persistent pain at the site of injection immediately and a generalised macro-papular reaction after 24 hours. The skin tests revealed positive delayed reactions of 24 hours and 48 hours by IDR and patch tests to only some PRC with common chains in their structures. The positive skin tests are in favour of immunological reactions and may help in diagnosis of allergy in the patients.\nrelations:\n[[\"Positive skin tests\", \"are observed in\", \"delayed reactions to radiographic contrast media\"],\n [\"Delayed reactions to radiographic contrast media\", \"have been described with increasing frequency in\", \"the last few years\"],\n [\"Patients with delayed reactions\", \"undergo intradermoreactions and patch tests to\", \"a series of ionic and non ionic radiographic contrast media\"],\n [\"Patient n\u00b01\", \"experiences a biphasic reaction with an immediate reaction and a delayed macro-papular rash after\", \"angiography by the venous route\"],\n [\"Patient n\u00b02\", \"experiences a generalised sensation of heat, persistent pain at the site of injection immediately and a generalised macro-papular reaction after\", \"24 hours\"],\n [\"Skin tests\", \"reveal positive delayed reactions of\", \"24 hours and 48 hours by intradermoreactions and patch tests to\", \"only some radiographic contrast media with common chains in their structures\"],\n [\"Positive skin tests\", \"indicate immunological reactions and may help in diagnosis of allergy in\", \"patients\"]]</s>",

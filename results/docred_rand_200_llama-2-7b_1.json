      "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

      "The Sims class destroyers were built for the United States Navy , and commissioned in 1939 and 1940 . These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II . All Sims - class ships saw action in World War II , and seven survived the war . No ship of this class saw service after 1946 .

      "The French Resistance ( ) was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime during the Second World War . Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first - hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines . The men and women of the Resistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society , including \u00e9migr\u00e9s , academics , students , aristocrats , conservative Roman Catholics ( including priests ) , and also citizens from the ranks of liberals , anarchists and communists . The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser - known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . The Resistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks .

      "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad .

      "The Private Life of Helen of Troy is a 1927 American silent film about Helen of Troy based on the 1925 novel of the same name by John Erskine , and adapted to screen by Gerald Duffy . The film was directed by Alexander Korda and starred Mar\u00eda Corda as Helen , Lewis Stone as Menelaus , and Ricardo Cortez as Paris . Coming at the end of the silent film era , it was nominated for an Academy Award in 1929 , the year of the Awards ' inception , in the category of Best Title Writing . Duffy died on 25 June 1928 , and was the first person to be posthumously nominated for an Academy Award .

      "The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum ( ) was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia , Bulgaria , from 1949 to 1999 . The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past .

      "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .

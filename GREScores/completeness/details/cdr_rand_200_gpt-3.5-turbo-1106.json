      "Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix .|BACKGROUND : The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma .|METHODS : The combination of carboplatin ( area under the concentration curve [ AUC ] , 5 ) and liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ; starting dose , 40 mg / m ( 2 ) ) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile .|RESULTS : Twenty - nine patients were assessable for response , and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity .|The overall response rate was 38 % , the median time to response was 10 weeks , the median duration of response was 26 weeks , and the median survival was 37 weeks .|The main toxic effect was myelosuppression , with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients , anemia in 12 patients , thrombocytopenia in 11 patients , and neutropenic fever in 3 patients .|Four patients had five infusion - related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin , leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients .|Grade > or = 2 nonhematologic toxicity included nausea in 17 patients , emesis in 14 patients , fatigue in 9 patients , mucositis and / or stomatitis in 8 patients , constipation in 6 patients , weight loss in 5 patients , hand - foot syndrome in 2 patients , and skin reactions in 3 patients .|CONCLUSIONS : The combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin has modest activity in patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall .|BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .|The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations .|dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .|Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L .|Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .|Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .|An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .|Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .": {

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": {

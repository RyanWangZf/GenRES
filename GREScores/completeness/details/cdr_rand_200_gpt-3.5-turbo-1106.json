      "Quinine - induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria .|It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia ( premature ventricular contraction ) while getting quinine infusion was reported .|A man , 25 years old , was admitted to hospital with high fever , chill , vomiting , jaundice .|The patient was fully conscious , blood pressure 120 / 80 mmHg , pulse rate 100 x / minute , regular .|On admission , laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum ( + + + + ) , total bilirubin 8 . 25 mg / dL , conjugated bilirubin 4 . 36 mg / dL , unconjugated bilirubin 3 . 89 mg / dL , potassium 3 . 52 meq / L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5 % 500 mg / 8 hour .|On the second day the patient had vomitus , diarrhea , tinnitus , loss of hearing .|After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography ( ECG ) recording showed premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) > 5 x / minute , trigemini , constant type - - sinoatrial block , positive U wave .|He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5 % / 24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet .|Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets .|Three hours later the patient felt better , the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x / minute and on the third day ECG was normal , potassium level was 3 . 34 meq / L .|He was discharged on 7th day in good condition .|Quinine , like quinidine , is a chincona alkaloid that has anti - arrhythmic property , although it also pro - arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias , including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC .|Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro - arrhythmic effect , especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder ( hypokalemia ) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases .": {

      "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy .|PURPOSE : Apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few .|Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce .|Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy .|METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions .|Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph .|This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI ) on a breath - by - breath basis .|RESULTS : The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .|Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .|The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE .|In the epileptic group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group .|Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups .|CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined .|We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions .": {

      "Cocaine - induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .|The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine - and amphetamine - induced hyperactivity was examined in mice .|All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice , and the effects were dose - dependent .|It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction .|Moreover , all adenosine receptor agonists : 2 - p - ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phenethylamino - 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( CGS 21680 ) , A2A receptor agonist , N6 - cyclopentyladenosine ( CPA ) , A1 receptor agonist , and 5 ' - N - ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ( NECA ) , A2 / A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose - dependently decreased cocaine - induced locomotor activity .|CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which , given alone , did not influence motility , while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which , given alone , decreased locomotor activity in animals .|These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it .|The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX ( 3 , 7 - dimethyl - 1 - propargylxanthine ) significantly enhanced cocaine - induced locomotor activity of animals .|Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant .|CPT ( 8 - cyclopentyltheophylline ) - - A1 receptor antagonist , did not show any influence in this test .|Similarly , all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine - induced hyperactivity , but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine - induced hyperactivity .|The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors ( DMPX ) and non - selective blockade of adenosine receptors ( caffeine ) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test .|Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists ( A1 and A2 ) reduce cocaine - and amphetamine - induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine - induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists ( particularly A1 receptors ) than amphetamine - induced hyperactivity .": {

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|BACKGROUND AND AIM : Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia .|This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|METHODS : Eighty - eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon - alpha - 2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study .|A hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g / dL was defined as ribavirin - induced anemia .|RESULTS : Ribavirin - induced anemia occurred in 18 ( 20 . 5 % ) patients during treatment .|A 2 g / dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment .|The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or = 2 g / dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with < 2 g / dL decrease ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|Such factors as sex ( female ) , age ( > or = 60 years old ) , and the ribavirin dose by body weight ( 12 mg / kg or more ) were significant by univariate analysis .|CONCLUSIONS : Careful administration is necessary in patients > or = 60 years old , in female patients , and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg / kg or more .|Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g / dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Efficacy and safety of granisetron , a selective 5 - hydroxytryptamine - 3 receptor antagonist , in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high - dose cisplatin .|PURPOSE : To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron ( Kytril ; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals , Philadelphia , PA ) when administered as a single intravenous ( IV ) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin - induced nausea and vomiting .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : One hundred eighty - four chemotherapy - naive patients receiving high - dose cisplatin ( 81 to 120 mg / m2 ) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses ( 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 micrograms / kg ) administered before chemotherapy .|Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours , and vital signs , nausea , vomiting , retching , and appetite were assessed .|Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes .|RESULTS : After granisetron doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 micrograms / kg , a major response ( < or = two vomiting or retching episodes , and no antiemetic rescue ) was recorded in 23 % , 57 % , 58 % , and 60 % of patients , respectively , and a complete response ( no vomiting or retching , and no antiemetic rescue ) in 18 % , 41 % , 40 % , and 47 % of patients , respectively .|There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea ( P = . 0015 ) and vomiting ( P = . 0001 ) , and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10 - micrograms / kg dosing groups than in the 5 - micrograms / kg dosing group .|As granisetron dose increased , appetite return increased ( P = . 040 ) .|Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event ( 20 % ) .|CONCLUSION : A single 10 - , 20 - , or 40 - micrograms / kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57 % to 60 % of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg / m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40 % to 47 % of patients .|There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10 - micrograms / kg dose and the 20 - and 40 - micrograms / kg doses .|Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses .": {

      "Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining .|By 2 hours , parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage , and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion .|Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours .|By 6 h , vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR .|By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR .|By 48 - 72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area .|In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR .|Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus .|Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR .|Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus .": {

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Incidence of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients : a retrospective cohort analysis .|BACKGROUND : Thrombocytopenia in patients with end - stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension , low levels of thrombopoetin , and endotoxemia .|The impact of immune - mediated heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type II ( HIT type II ) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood , with few literature citations reporting contradictory results .|The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II .|METHOD : We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full - size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end - stage or malignant liver disease .|Preoperative platelet count , postoperative course of platelets , and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed .|RESULTS : A total of 155 ( 75 . 6 % ) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation , significantly influenced by Model of End - Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis .|The platelet count exceeded 100 , 000 / uL in most of the patients ( n = 193 ) at a medium of 7 d .|Regarding HIT II , there were four ( 1 . 95 % ) patients with a background of HIT type II .|CONCLUSIONS : The incidence of HIT in patients with end - stage hepatic failure is , with about 1 . 95 % , rare .|For further reduction of HIT type II , the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low - molecular - weight heparin after normalization of platelet count .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

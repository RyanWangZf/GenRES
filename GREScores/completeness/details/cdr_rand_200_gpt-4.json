      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Prevention of etomidate - induced myoclonus : which is superior : Fentanyl , midazolam , or a combination ? A Retrospective comparative study .|BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl , midazolam , and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate - induced myoclonus .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records .|Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , fentanyl 1 ug . kg - 1 ( Group F ) , midazolam 0 . 03 mg . kg - 1 ( Group M ) , and midazolam 0 . 015 mg . kg - 1 + fentanyl 0 . 5 ug . kg - 1 ( Group FM ) .|Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0 . 3 mg . kg - 1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20 - 30 seconds .|Myoclonic movements are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection .|The severity of pain due to etomidate injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated .|RESULTS : Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM .|CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate - induced myoclonus .": {

      "Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin given in the form of N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide conjugates : and experimental study in the rat .|A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin ( DOX ) given either as free drug or in the form of three N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide ( HPMA ) copolymer conjugates .|In these HPMA copolymers , DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non - biodegradable ( Gly - Gly ) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( Gly - Phe - Leu - Gly ) .|In addition , one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used ; this residue was targeted to the liver .|Over the first 3 weeks after the i . v .|administration of free and polymer - bound DOX , all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight .|However , the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer - bound DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ; P less than 0 . 01 ) .|Throughout the study ( 20 weeks ) , deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX ; in these cases , histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .|Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30 % in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration .|The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12 % lower than that measured in age - matched control rats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|In addition , no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study .|However , these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .

      "Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall .|BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .|The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations .|dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .|Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L .|Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .|Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .|An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .|Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .": {

      "Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery .|BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions , including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure , during functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway ( FRLMA ) versus endotracheal tube ( ETT ) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol - remifentanil total i . v .|anesthesia ( TIVA ) .|METHODS : Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I - II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol - remifentanil - TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups : group I , FRLMA ; group II , ETT .|Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six - point scale .|RESULTS : Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil .|CONCLUSION : In summary , our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS .": {

      "Drug - induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors .|BACKGROUND : Drug - induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction .|Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose - dependent manner .|In the inpatient setting , the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug - drug interactions remain unknown .|METHODS : We performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 - year period in a tertiary care hospital .|A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone .|In addition to methadone dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation .|RESULTS : Among 167 methadone maintenance patients , the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0 . 50 second ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) or longer was 16 . 2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjects .|Six patients ( 3 . 6 % ) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes .|QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient , 0 . 20 ; P < . 01 ) .|Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31 . 8 % of QTc variability to methadone dose , cytochrome P - 450 3A4 drug - drug interactions , hypokalemia , and altered liver function .|CONCLUSIONS : QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding .|Methadone dose , presence of cytochrome P - 450 3A4 inhibitors , potassium level , and liver function contribute to QT prolongation .|Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": {

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin given in the form of N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide conjugates : and experimental study in the rat .|A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin ( DOX ) given either as free drug or in the form of three N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide ( HPMA ) copolymer conjugates .|In these HPMA copolymers , DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non - biodegradable ( Gly - Gly ) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( Gly - Phe - Leu - Gly ) .|In addition , one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used ; this residue was targeted to the liver .|Over the first 3 weeks after the i . v .|administration of free and polymer - bound DOX , all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight .|However , the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer - bound DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ; P less than 0 . 01 ) .|Throughout the study ( 20 weeks ) , deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX ; in these cases , histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .|Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30 % in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration .|The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12 % lower than that measured in age - matched control rats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|In addition , no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study .|However , these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .

      "Gemfibrozil - lovastatin therapy for primary hyperlipoproteinemias .|The specific aim of this retrospective , observational study was to assess safety and efficacy of long - term ( 21 months / patient ) , open - label , gemfibrozil - lovastatin treatment in 80 patients with primary mixed hyperlipidemia ( 68 % of whom had atherosclerotic vascular disease ) .|Because ideal lipid targets were not reached ( low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol less than 130 mg / dl , high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol greater than 35 mg / dl , or total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol less than 4 . 5 mg / dl ) with diet plus a single drug , gemfibrozil ( 1 . 2 g / day ) - lovastatin ( primarily 20 or 40 mg ) treatment was given .|Follow - up visits were scheduled with 2 - drug therapy every 6 to 8 weeks , an average of 10 . 3 visits per patient , with 741 batteries of 6 liver function tests and 714 creatine phosphokinase levels measured .|Only 1 of the 4 , 446 liver function tests ( 0 . 02 % ) , a gamma glutamyl transferase , was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit .|Of the 714 creatine phosphokinase levels , 9 % were high ; only 1 ( 0 . 1 % ) was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit .|With 2 - drug therapy , mean total cholesterol decreased 22 % from 255 to 200 mg / dl , triglyceride levels decreased 35 % from 236 to 154 mg / dl , LDL cholesterol decreased 26 % from 176 to 131 mg / dl , and the total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol ratio decreased 24 % from 7 . 1 to 5 . 4 , all p less than or equal to 0 . 0001 .|Myositis , attributable to the drug combination and symptomatic enough to discontinue it , occurred in 3 % of patients , and in 1 % with concurrent high creatine phosphokinase ( 769 U / liter ) ; no patients had rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria .

      "Does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine - associated restless legs syndrome ?|There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) .|For example , the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists , whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms .|To our knowledge , there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone , a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS .|Mirtazapine , the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA ) , has been associated with RLS in several recent publications .|The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy .|Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine , and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine .|Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine - associated RLS .|However , physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with RLS in some individuals , especially those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists .": {

      "Succimer chelation improves learning , attention , and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure .|BACKGROUND : There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels .|However , very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children , or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure .|OBJECTIVES : The present study was designed to answer these questions , using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer , a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning .|RESULTS : Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation , paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children .|Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning , attention , and arousal regulation , although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit .|In contrast , succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen .|CONCLUSIONS : These are the first data , to our knowledge , to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure .|These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children .|However , they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals .": {

      "Case - control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory use and end - stage renal disease .|BACKGROUND : Studies on the association between the long - term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) have given conflicting results .|In order to examine this association , a case - control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out .|METHODS : The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1 , 1995 and November 30 , 1997 .|They were classified according to the underlying disease , which had presumably led them to ESRD .|Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose , also matched by age and sex .|Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model , including potential confounding factors , both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases .|RESULTS : Five hundred and eighty - three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis .|Long - term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1 . 22 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 89 - 1 . 66 ) .|For specific groups of drugs , the risks were 1 . 56 ( 1 . 05 - 2 . 30 ) for aspirin , 1 . 03 ( 0 . 60 - 1 . 76 ) for pyrazolones , 0 . 80 ( 0 . 39 - 1 . 63 ) for paracetamol , and 0 . 94 ( 0 . 57 - 1 . 56 ) for nonaspirin NSAIDs .|The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use , and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [ 2 . 35 ( 1 . 17 - 4 . 72 ) ] .|CONCLUSION : Our data indicate that long - term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD .|However , the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD .": {

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Incidence of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients : a retrospective cohort analysis .|BACKGROUND : Thrombocytopenia in patients with end - stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension , low levels of thrombopoetin , and endotoxemia .|The impact of immune - mediated heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type II ( HIT type II ) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood , with few literature citations reporting contradictory results .|The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II .|METHOD : We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full - size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end - stage or malignant liver disease .|Preoperative platelet count , postoperative course of platelets , and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed .|RESULTS : A total of 155 ( 75 . 6 % ) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation , significantly influenced by Model of End - Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis .|The platelet count exceeded 100 , 000 / uL in most of the patients ( n = 193 ) at a medium of 7 d .|Regarding HIT II , there were four ( 1 . 95 % ) patients with a background of HIT type II .|CONCLUSIONS : The incidence of HIT in patients with end - stage hepatic failure is , with about 1 . 95 % , rare .|For further reduction of HIT type II , the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low - molecular - weight heparin after normalization of platelet count .": {

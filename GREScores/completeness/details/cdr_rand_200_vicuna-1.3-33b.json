      "Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery .|BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions , including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure , during functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway ( FRLMA ) versus endotracheal tube ( ETT ) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol - remifentanil total i . v .|anesthesia ( TIVA ) .|METHODS : Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I - II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol - remifentanil - TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups : group I , FRLMA ; group II , ETT .|Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six - point scale .|RESULTS : Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil .|CONCLUSION : In summary , our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS .": {

      "Absence of PKC - alpha attenuates lithium - induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus .|Lithium , an effective antipsychotic , induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) in 40 % of patients .|The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter ( UT - A1 ) and water channel ( AQP2 ) expression in the inner medulla .|Targeting an alternative signaling pathway , such as PKC - mediated signaling , may be an effective method of treating lithium - induced polyuria .|PKC - alpha null mice ( PKCa KO ) and strain - matched wild type ( WT ) controls were treated with lithium for 0 , 3 or 5 days .|WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration .|Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice ; however , AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO .|Similar results were observed with UT - A1 expression .|Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks .|Lithium - treated WT mice had 19 - fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4 - fold increase in output .|AQP2 and UT - A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium - treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice , AQP2 was only reduced by 2 - fold and UT - A1 expression was unaffected .|Urinary sodium , potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium - fed WT but not in lithium - fed PKCa KO mice .|Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT - A1 protein expression and localization in lithium - induced NDI , and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy .": {

      "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .": {

      "Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine - induced seizures .|Garcinielliptone FC ( GFC ) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart .|It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases .|However , there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents .|The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25 , 50 or 75 mg / kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid ( r - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine , aspartate and glutathione ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures .|GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure , at doses 25mg / kg ( 20 . 12 + 2 . 20 min ) , 50mg / kg ( 20 . 95 + 2 . 21 min ) or 75 mg / kg ( 23 . 43 + 1 . 99 min ) when compared with seized mice .|In addition , GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46 . 90 % when compared with seized mice .|In aspartate , glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5 . 21 % , 13 . 55 % and 21 . 80 % , respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice .|Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63 . 30 % ) when compared with seized mice .|The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus , as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals .|In conclusion , our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus .|This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": {

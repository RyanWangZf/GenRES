      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": {

      "Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|BACKGROUND : Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults .|These well - documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children .|DESIGN : A prospective study to monitor indinavir - related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|METHODS : Urinary pH , albumin , creatinine , the presence of erythrocytes , leukocytes , bacteria and crystals , and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks .|Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points .|Steady - state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir .|RESULTS : The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia ( > or = 75 cells / micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits ) after 96 weeks was 53 % .|Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin / creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria .|The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia .|In children younger than 5 . 6 years , persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children .|A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg / L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir > 12 mg / L .|In 4 children , indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity .|Subsequently , the serum creatinine levels decreased , the urine albumin / creatinine ratios returned to zero , and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months .|CONCLUSIONS : Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal .|Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications .|The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis .|Indinavir - associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely , especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia , age < 5 . 6 years , an area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg / L x h , and a C ( max ) > 12 mg / L .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "Safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy .|PURPOSE : To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy .|METHODS : A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients ( 11 eyes ) .|Eleven patients ( 11 eyes ) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) .|Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline , before fluocinolone acetonide implant , and then at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years .|Disease activity markers , including signs of ocular inflammation , evidence of retinal vasculitis , Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis , electroretinographic parameters , and optical coherence tomography were recorded .|Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes .|RESULTS : Intraocular inflammation was present in 54 . 5 , 9 . 9 , 11 . 1 , and 0 % of patients at baseline , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant , respectively .|Active vasculitis was noted in 36 . 3 % patients at baseline and 0 % at 3 years of follow - up .|More than 20 % ( 47 . 61 - 67 . 2 % ) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant .|At baseline , 54 . 5 % patients were on immunomodulatory agents .|This percentage decreased to 45 . 45 , 44 . 4 , and 14 . 28 % at 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant , respectively .|Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure ( 54 . 5 % ) and cataract formation ( 100 % ) .|CONCLUSION : The data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment - refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy .|It is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment .": {

      "Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first - episode schizophrenia : 4 - month outcomes .|OBJECTIVE : The authors compared 4 - month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first - episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders .|METHOD : One hundred twelve subjects ( 70 % male ; mean age = 23 . 3 years [ SD = 5 . 1 ] ) with first - episode schizophrenia ( 75 % ) , schizophreniform disorder ( 17 % ) , or schizoaffective disorder ( 8 % ) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine ( 2 . 5 - 20 mg / day ) or risperidone ( 1 - 6 mg / day ) .|RESULTS : Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine ( 43 . 7 % , 95 % CI = 28 . 8 % - 58 . 6 % ) and risperidone ( 54 . 3 % , 95 % CI = 39 . 9 % - 68 . 7 % ) .|Among those responding to treatment , more subjects in the olanzapine group ( 40 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 16 . 8 % - 65 . 0 % ) than in the risperidone group ( 18 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 0 % - 39 . 2 % ) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria .|Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications .|Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1 . 4 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 2 - 1 . 6 ) with risperidone and 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 0 - 1 . 4 ) with olanzapine .|Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone : the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 14 . 2 % - 20 . 5 % ) with olanzapine and 11 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 8 . 4 % - 14 . 3 % ) with risperidone .|Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24 . 3 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 8 - 25 . 7 ) versus 28 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 26 . 7 - 29 . 7 ) with olanzapine and 23 . 9 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 5 - 25 . 3 ) versus 26 . 7 ( 95 % CI = 25 . 2 - 28 . 2 ) with risperidone .|CONCLUSIONS : Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine , and response may be more stable .|Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects .|Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain , but weight gain was greater with olanzapine .": {

      "\" Real - world \" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice : a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group .|Lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( RD ) is a standard of care for relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) , but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the \" real world \" ( RW ) , according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition .|We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW .|Objective response ( > PR ( partial response ) ) rate was 77 . 4 % ( complete response ( CR ) , 20 . 2 % ) .|Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months , respectively .|Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or > 2 ( nd ) - line treatment at 4 and 11 months , respectively .|Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib .|Median duration of response was 34 . 4 months , and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression ( not reached versus 19 months , p < 0 . 001 ) .|Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders ( p < 0 . 001 ) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease .|Adverse events were reported in 68 . 9 % of patients ( myelosuppression in 49 . 4 % ) and 12 . 7 % of patients needed hospitalization .|Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2 . 5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5 . 7 % .|Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38 . 9 % .|Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16 . 8 months .|Performance status ( PS ) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation .|Extra - medullary relapses occurred in 3 . 8 % of patients .|Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW ; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

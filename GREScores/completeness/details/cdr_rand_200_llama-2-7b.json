      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy .|PURPOSE : To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy .|METHODS : A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients ( 11 eyes ) .|Eleven patients ( 11 eyes ) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) .|Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline , before fluocinolone acetonide implant , and then at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years .|Disease activity markers , including signs of ocular inflammation , evidence of retinal vasculitis , Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis , electroretinographic parameters , and optical coherence tomography were recorded .|Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes .|RESULTS : Intraocular inflammation was present in 54 . 5 , 9 . 9 , 11 . 1 , and 0 % of patients at baseline , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 3 years , and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant , respectively .|Active vasculitis was noted in 36 . 3 % patients at baseline and 0 % at 3 years of follow - up .|More than 20 % ( 47 . 61 - 67 . 2 % ) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant .|At baseline , 54 . 5 % patients were on immunomodulatory agents .|This percentage decreased to 45 . 45 , 44 . 4 , and 14 . 28 % at 1 year , 2 years , and 3 years postimplant , respectively .|Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure ( 54 . 5 % ) and cataract formation ( 100 % ) .|CONCLUSION : The data suggest that fluocinolone acetonide implant ( 0 . 59 mg ) helps to control inflammation in otherwise treatment - refractory cases of birdshot retinochoroidopathy .|It is associated with significant side effects of cataract and ocular hypertension requiring treatment .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

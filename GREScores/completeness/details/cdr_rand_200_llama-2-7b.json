      "Cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts .|Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia .|SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK , and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan .|We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised .|ATP ( 10 dogs ) or SNP ( 10 dogs ) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30 % to 70 % of control .|Before , during and after induced hypotension , we measured major cardiovascular parameters .|Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , left ventricular end - diastolic pressure ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , total body oxygen consumption ( p less than 0 . 05 ) , and heart rate ( p less than 0 . 001 ) ; all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped .|Cardiac output did not change .|During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0 . 01 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , left ventricular end - diastolic pressure ( p less than 0 . 01 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood ( p less than 0 . 05 ) , while heart rate ( p less than 0 . 001 ) and cardiac output ( p less than 0 . 05 ) were increased .|Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end - diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped .|Both ATP and SNP should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart .": {

      "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first - episode schizophrenia : 4 - month outcomes .|OBJECTIVE : The authors compared 4 - month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first - episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders .|METHOD : One hundred twelve subjects ( 70 % male ; mean age = 23 . 3 years [ SD = 5 . 1 ] ) with first - episode schizophrenia ( 75 % ) , schizophreniform disorder ( 17 % ) , or schizoaffective disorder ( 8 % ) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine ( 2 . 5 - 20 mg / day ) or risperidone ( 1 - 6 mg / day ) .|RESULTS : Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine ( 43 . 7 % , 95 % CI = 28 . 8 % - 58 . 6 % ) and risperidone ( 54 . 3 % , 95 % CI = 39 . 9 % - 68 . 7 % ) .|Among those responding to treatment , more subjects in the olanzapine group ( 40 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 16 . 8 % - 65 . 0 % ) than in the risperidone group ( 18 . 9 % , 95 % CI = 0 % - 39 . 2 % ) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria .|Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications .|Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1 . 4 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 2 - 1 . 6 ) with risperidone and 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 0 - 1 . 4 ) with olanzapine .|Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone : the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 14 . 2 % - 20 . 5 % ) with olanzapine and 11 . 3 % ( 95 % CI = 8 . 4 % - 14 . 3 % ) with risperidone .|Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24 . 3 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 8 - 25 . 7 ) versus 28 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 26 . 7 - 29 . 7 ) with olanzapine and 23 . 9 ( 95 % CI = 22 . 5 - 25 . 3 ) versus 26 . 7 ( 95 % CI = 25 . 2 - 28 . 2 ) with risperidone .|CONCLUSIONS : Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine , and response may be more stable .|Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects .|Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain , but weight gain was greater with olanzapine .": {

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

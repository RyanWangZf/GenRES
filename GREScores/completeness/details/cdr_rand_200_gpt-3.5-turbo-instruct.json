      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|BACKGROUND : Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults .|These well - documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children .|DESIGN : A prospective study to monitor indinavir - related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected children treated with indinavir .|METHODS : Urinary pH , albumin , creatinine , the presence of erythrocytes , leukocytes , bacteria and crystals , and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks .|Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points .|Steady - state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir .|RESULTS : The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia ( > or = 75 cells / micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits ) after 96 weeks was 53 % .|Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin / creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria .|The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia .|In children younger than 5 . 6 years , persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children .|A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg / L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir > 12 mg / L .|In 4 children , indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity .|Subsequently , the serum creatinine levels decreased , the urine albumin / creatinine ratios returned to zero , and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months .|CONCLUSIONS : Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia .|Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal .|Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications .|The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis .|Indinavir - associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely , especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia , age < 5 . 6 years , an area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg / L x h , and a C ( max ) > 12 mg / L .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining .|By 2 hours , parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage , and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion .|Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours .|By 6 h , vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR .|By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR .|By 48 - 72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area .|In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR .|Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus .|Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR .|Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

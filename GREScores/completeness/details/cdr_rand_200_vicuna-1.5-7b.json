      "Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs .|The effects of i . v .|bolus administration of cromakalim ( 1 - 10 micrograms / kg ) and pinacidil ( 3 - 100 micrograms / kg ) on large ( circumflex artery ) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0 . 03 - 10 micrograms / kg ) .|Nitroglycerin , up to 0 . 3 micrograms / kg , selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD ) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter .|In contrast , cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0 . 3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose - dependently increased CxAD , coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure .|Cromakalim was approximately 8 - to 9 . 5 - fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD .|Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug - induced tachycardia was abolished .|When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant , the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim ( 10 micrograms / kg ) , pinacidil ( 30 micrograms / kg ) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg ) were reduced by 68 + / - 7 , 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1 % , respectively .|Thus , whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow - independently dilates large coronary arteries , cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors - mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand .|Finally , two mechanisms at least , direct vasodilation and flow dependency , are involved in the cromakalim - and pinacidil - induced increase in CxAD .": {

      "Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin given in the form of N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide conjugates : and experimental study in the rat .|A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin ( DOX ) given either as free drug or in the form of three N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide ( HPMA ) copolymer conjugates .|In these HPMA copolymers , DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non - biodegradable ( Gly - Gly ) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( Gly - Phe - Leu - Gly ) .|In addition , one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used ; this residue was targeted to the liver .|Over the first 3 weeks after the i . v .|administration of free and polymer - bound DOX , all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight .|However , the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer - bound DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ; P less than 0 . 01 ) .|Throughout the study ( 20 weeks ) , deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX ; in these cases , histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .|Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30 % in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration .|The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12 % lower than that measured in age - matched control rats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|In addition , no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study .|However , these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .

      "Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining .|By 2 hours , parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage , and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion .|Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours .|By 6 h , vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR .|By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR .|By 48 - 72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area .|In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR .|Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus .|Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR .|Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus .": {

      "Dose - dependent neurotoxicity of high - dose busulfan in children : a clinical and pharmacological study .|Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans , but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children .|We report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6 . 5 years ) receiving high - dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors , brain tumors excluded .|Busulfan was given p . o . , every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days .|Two total doses were consecutively used : 16 mg / kg , then 600 mg / m2 .|The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients ( 16 to 28 mg / kg ) .|Ninety - six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7 . 5 % ) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing .|When the total busulfan dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg / kg ( 1 of 57 , 1 . 7 % ) and patients under 600 mg / m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15 . 4 % ) ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .|Twenty - seven patients were given a 600 - mg / m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i . v .|infusion of clonazepam ; none had any neurological symptoms .|Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic - mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg / m2 busulfan with clonazepam : busulfan cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1 . 39 .|This was significantly different ( P less than 0 . 02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16 - mg / kg total dose of busulfan .|This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose - dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam .|A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased neurotoxicity , close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults .|Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16 - mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects .|The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .": {

      "Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy .|PURPOSE : Apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few .|Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce .|Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy .|METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions .|Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph .|This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI ) on a breath - by - breath basis .|RESULTS : The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .|Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .|The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE .|In the epileptic group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group .|Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups .|CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined .|We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions .": {

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Prevention of etomidate - induced myoclonus : which is superior : Fentanyl , midazolam , or a combination ? A Retrospective comparative study .|BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl , midazolam , and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate - induced myoclonus .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records .|Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , fentanyl 1 ug . kg - 1 ( Group F ) , midazolam 0 . 03 mg . kg - 1 ( Group M ) , and midazolam 0 . 015 mg . kg - 1 + fentanyl 0 . 5 ug . kg - 1 ( Group FM ) .|Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0 . 3 mg . kg - 1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20 - 30 seconds .|Myoclonic movements are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection .|The severity of pain due to etomidate injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated .|RESULTS : Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM .|CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate - induced myoclonus .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

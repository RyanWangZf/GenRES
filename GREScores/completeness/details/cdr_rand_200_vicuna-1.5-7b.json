      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Prevention of etomidate - induced myoclonus : which is superior : Fentanyl , midazolam , or a combination ? A Retrospective comparative study .|BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl , midazolam , and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate - induced myoclonus .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records .|Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , fentanyl 1 ug . kg - 1 ( Group F ) , midazolam 0 . 03 mg . kg - 1 ( Group M ) , and midazolam 0 . 015 mg . kg - 1 + fentanyl 0 . 5 ug . kg - 1 ( Group FM ) .|Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0 . 3 mg . kg - 1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20 - 30 seconds .|Myoclonic movements are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection .|The severity of pain due to etomidate injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated .|RESULTS : Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM .|CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate - induced myoclonus .": {

      "Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low - risk patients with cocaine - associated chest pain .|BACKGROUND : Most patients presenting to emergency departments ( EDs ) with cocaine - associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a \" rule out acute coronary syndrome \" protocol , often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge .|In patients without cocaine use , coronary computerized tomography angiography ( CTA ) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged .|It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine - associated chest pain , as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia .|We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine - associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge .|METHODS : We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low - risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain ( self - reported or positive urine test ) .|Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED ( without serial markers ) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements .|Patients with negative coronary CTA ( maximal stenosis less than 50 % ) were discharged .|The main outcome was 30 - day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction .|RESULTS : A total of 59 patients with cocaine - associated chest pain were evaluated .|Patients had a mean age of 45 . 6 + / - 6 . 6 yrs and were 86 % black , 66 % male .|Seventy - nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85 % had a TIMI score < 2 .|Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED , 18 of whom were discharged following CTA ( 90 % ) .|Thirty - nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period , with 37 discharged home following CTA ( 95 % ) .|Six patients had coronary stenosis > or = 50 % .|During the 30 - day follow - up period , no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Although cocaine - associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction , patients with cocaine associated chest pain , a non - ischemic ECG , and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30 - day adverse events .": {

      "Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining .|By 2 hours , parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage , and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion .|Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours .|By 6 h , vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR .|By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR .|By 48 - 72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area .|In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR .|Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus .|Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR .|Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus .": {

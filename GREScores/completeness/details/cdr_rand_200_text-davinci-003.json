      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the adult rat .|Following status epilepticus in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation .|It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus .|However , the population has never been quantified , so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis .|To quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus .|The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox - 1 , a granule - cell - specific marker , was estimated using the optical fractionator method .|The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial , and stable over time .|Interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures .|The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis , although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus .|The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .": {

      "Blockade of endothelial - mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .|OBJECTIVE : A multicenter , controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin - angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy , suggesting that other mechanism ( s ) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy ( diabetic nephropathy ) .|We have previously demonstrated that endothelial - mesenchymal - transition ( EndoMT ) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetes .|In the present study , we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy .|RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line ( MMEC ) in the presence of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) and in the endothelial lineage - traceble mouse line Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP by administration of AGEs , with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control .|Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation / Western blotting and confocal microscopy .|Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3 ) were performed in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .|RESULTS : Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .|Immunoprecipitation / Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy .|Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT , reduced renal fibrosis , and retarded progression of nephropathy .|CONCLUSIONS : EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy .|Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications .": {

      "Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users .|INTRODUCTION : The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction .|The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Three groups , comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN ) , 30 occasional cocaine ( OC ) , and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC ) users , were compared .|An emotional facial expression ( EFE ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surprise , sadness , anger , fear , and disgust ) was administered .|Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived .|Participants were also assessed with the \" Eyes task \" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology .|RESULTS : There were no group differences in psychopathology or \" eyes task \" performance , but the RC group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group , exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups .|The RC group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surprise , more slowly than CN , but not OC participants .|The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust .|The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group can not be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine , or ecstasy , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired .|Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .": {

      "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .": {

      "Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine - induced seizures .|Garcinielliptone FC ( GFC ) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart .|It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases .|However , there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents .|The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25 , 50 or 75 mg / kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid ( r - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine , aspartate and glutathione ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures .|GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure , at doses 25mg / kg ( 20 . 12 + 2 . 20 min ) , 50mg / kg ( 20 . 95 + 2 . 21 min ) or 75 mg / kg ( 23 . 43 + 1 . 99 min ) when compared with seized mice .|In addition , GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46 . 90 % when compared with seized mice .|In aspartate , glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5 . 21 % , 13 . 55 % and 21 . 80 % , respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice .|Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63 . 30 % ) when compared with seized mice .|The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus , as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals .|In conclusion , our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus .|This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin given in the form of N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide conjugates : and experimental study in the rat .|A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin ( DOX ) given either as free drug or in the form of three N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide ( HPMA ) copolymer conjugates .|In these HPMA copolymers , DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non - biodegradable ( Gly - Gly ) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases ( Gly - Phe - Leu - Gly ) .|In addition , one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used ; this residue was targeted to the liver .|Over the first 3 weeks after the i . v .|administration of free and polymer - bound DOX , all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight .|However , the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer - bound DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX ( 4 mg / kg ; P less than 0 . 01 ) .|Throughout the study ( 20 weeks ) , deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX ; in these cases , histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX - induced cardiotoxicity .|Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30 % in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration .|The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12 % lower than that measured in age - matched control rats ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .|In addition , no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study .|However , these animals had shown a significant increase in heart rate beginning at 8 weeks after drug administration ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Etiology of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients on calcium carbonate therapy .|Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients ( 36 % ) became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder .|In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia , indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age , sex , length of time on dialysis , and etiology of renal disease .|In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2 . 7 to 3 . 8 mmol / L ( 10 . 7 to 15 . 0 mg / dL ) , patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch , compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch ( 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 03 to 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 03 mmol / L [ 9 . 7 + / - 0 . 2 to 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 1 mg / dL ] , P = 0 . 006 ) .|In contrast , eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean calcium values over the same time period ( 2 . 3 + / - 0 . 05 to 2 . 3 + / - 0 . 05 mmol / L [ 9 . 2 + / - 0 . 2 to 9 . 2 + / - 0 . 2 mg / dL ] ) .|CaCO3 dosage , calculated dietary calcium intake , and circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites were similar in both groups .|Physical activity index and predialysis serum bicarbonate levels also were similar in both groups .|However , there was a significant difference in parameters reflecting bone turnover rates between groups .

      "Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin - induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy .|Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose - limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin .|Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process .|The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol , a nonselective beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties , protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity .|Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin ( 2 mg / kg sc / week ) , carvedilol ( 1 mg / kg ip / week ) , or the combination of the two drugs .|Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin - treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration ( 336 + / - 26 versus 425 + / - 53 natom O / min / mg protein ) and a lower respiratory control ratio ( RCR ) ( 4 . 3 + / - 0 . 6 versus 5 . 8 + / - 0 . 4 ) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline - treated rats .|Mitochondrial calcium - loading capacity and the activity of NADH - dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin - treated rats .|Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria ( 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 9 versus 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 for control rats ) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity .|Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver .|Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca ( 2 + ) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin .|Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria .|It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose - limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long - term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy .|PURPOSE : Apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few .|Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce .|Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine - induced epilepsy .|METHODS : Twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given tracheotomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions .|Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph .|This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a polygraph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , inspiratory time ( TI ) , expiratory time ( TE ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( VT / TI ) on a breath - by - breath basis .|RESULTS : The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .|Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .|The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2 , followed by an increase in VE .|In the epileptic group , the increase in VE was mediated by a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group .|Systemic application of KCN , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in VE for both groups .|CONCLUSIONS : The data indicate that pilocarpine - treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined .|We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy - associated conditions .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson 's disease : clues from dyskinetic patients .|The plasticity of primary motor cortex ( M1 ) in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs ) is severely impaired .|We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) .|This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation .|This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity , indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity .|The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known .|To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1 , we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS - induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral , real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation .|Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 .|These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function , occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it , may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

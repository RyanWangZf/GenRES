Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be , nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states ; because of this , the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source . A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region ( e.g. , \u00a0 New York City or Philadelphia ) . However , some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position ( e.g. , \u00a0 Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth metroplex , Norfolk - Virginia Beach ( Hampton Roads ) , Riverside \u2013 San Bernardino ( Inland Empire ) or Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul ( Twin Cities ) ) . MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes . ": {

      "Tomcats Screaming Outside is the first ( and to date only ) solo album from British musician Roland Orzabal of the group Tears for Fears , and was released on 2 April 2001 . Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s ( following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith ) , this was the first recording to be released under his own name . This album was Orzabal 's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths , who co - wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums . The album was given a low - key release and did not chart , but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum ' n bass , ambient techno and trip hop textures . Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com 's editorial review : \" Solo album or not , Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade . \" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album : \" I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach , with drum and bass / jungle ... and I ended up with something that was n't the original plan . \" The US release of the album ( on Gold Circle Records ) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11 , 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst - ever terrorist attack , and drew little notice outside TFF 's core fan base .

It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main political prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security , the Stasi . Unlike many other government and military institutions in East Germany , Hohensch\u00f6nhausen prison was not stormed by demonstrators after the fall of the Berlin Wall , allowing prison authorities to destroy evidence of the prison 's functions and history . Because of this , today 's knowledge of the functioning of the prison comes mainly from eye - witness accounts and documents sourced from other East German institutions . The prison was depicted in the 2006 film The Lives of Others , and in 2017 TV series The Same Sky . It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience . ": {

      "Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball , and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League . In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . It is composed of 30 teams . The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . Originally , three drafts were held each year . The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues . The August draft was eliminated after two years , and the January draft lasted until 1986 . The draft order is determined based on the previous season 's standings , with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick . In addition , teams that lost free agents in the previous off - season may be awarded \" compensatory \" picks . ": {

Ayala has filed lawsuits disputing this action in the Supreme Court of Florida , and in federal court . Ayala lost her Supreme Court case against Gov Rick Scott . The Florida Supreme Court ruled against Ayala saying the Governor was within his power to take cases away from Ayala because of her position to abandon the death penalty . ": {

      "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

      "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .

The lake and park have a fishing dock , wading pool , tennis courts , and softball diamonds . There is a recreation center that hosts activities . The lake borders a municipal golf course . In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks . There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls . Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows , and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River .

      "Piracy on Falcon Lake refers to an increase in crime at the border between the United States and Mexico on Falcon Lake . The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route . A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast . The so - called pirates operate \" fleets \" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs . While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy , all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .

      "The ( Austrian ) Ost Autobahn A4 or \" Eastern Motorway \" is part of the European route E60 and goes from Vienna to the town of Nickelsdorf , on the Hungarian border . The road begins at the A23 at the Prater junction in Vienna , travels through Simmering , Schwechat , Vienna International Airport , Fischamend , Bruck an der Leitha , Parndorf , Weiden am See and M\u00f6nchhof to the border town of Nickelsdorf . Crossing the border into Hegyeshalom , the road becomes the Hungarian M1 motorway which then continues on to Budapest . The road is 66 \u00a0 km long . During the overflow of asylum seekers traveling from Hungary during September 2015 , the highway was closed intermittently preventing the traffic between Hungary and Austria , and it was reported that Austrian army was deployed on the border .

In the case of others such as the Mackenzie , it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries , as noted . Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less . Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi , the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do . Nine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them . Four \u2014 the Yukon , Columbia , Porcupine , and Kootenay \u2014 begin in Canada and flow into the United States . Five \u2014 the Milk , Pend d'Oreille , Saint Lawrence , Red , and Saint John \u2014 begin in the United States and flow into Canada . Of these , the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice , the Milk leaving and then re - entering the United States , the Kootenay leaving and then re - entering Canada . The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries ; in addition , the drainage basins of six others \u2014 the Fraser , Assiniboine , South Saskatchewan , Saskatchewan , Nelson , and Winnipeg \u2014 extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada . Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision . Biologist and author Ruth Patrick , describing a table of high - discharge rivers , wrote that data on discharge , drainage area , and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted . \" It seems , \" she said , \" that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers , and not to place too much importance on minor ( 10\u201320 % ) differences in figures . \" ": {

      "The Committee against the Finnish White Terror ( ) was an organization in Sweden , formed at the end of the Finnish Civil War . The formation of the Committee was preceded by a call from the Social Democratic Left Party published in Politiken in February 1918 to mobilize protests around the country to counter the official Swedish government position on the Finnish question . The Committee sought to unite the Swedish labour movement for a common position against what they termed the \u201d White Terror \u201d in Finland . The Committee raised funds for humanitarian aid to the victims of the repression . The Committee also opposed denials of political asylum for Finnish refugees . Sven Linderot was one of the three members of the Committee . The Committee managed to gather 21,851.53 kronor , 14,518.73 for Finnish refugees in Sweden and 6,920 kronor for affected in Finland . The Committee published 100,000 leaflets titled ' Truth about Finland ' , and more than 100 public meetings were organized . ": {

      "Tonie Marshall ( born 29 November 1951 ) is a French American actress , screenwriter , and film director . After acting in several of Jacques Demy \u2019s films , including A Slightly Pregnant Man and La Naissance du Jour , Marshall cites to have taken influence from his direction in the sense of creating whimsical atmospheres and rooting the stories with more of a female - centric narrative . In her most notable film , Venus Beauty Institute , Marshall \u2019s touched on the theme of finding love from a female perspective , and how it can fundamentally be more difficult because of how it strays from the traditional dynamic of courtship . She explains how \u201c in a practical sense , it \u2019s complicated to have abandon [ oneself ] into a man \u2019s arms and , at the same time , stay very tough because you have to work \u2026 \u201d . This carefully expresses the vulnerabilities women endure when heavily committing to relationships , similar to much of Demy \u2019s work , including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort .

Trump has proposed sizable income tax cuts and deregulation consistent with conservative ( Republican Party ) policies , along with significant infrastructure investment and protection for entitlements for the elderly , typically considered liberal ( Democratic Party ) policies . His anti - globalization policies of trade protectionism and immigration reduction cross party lines . Trump has said that he is \" totally flexible on very , very many issues . \" Trump 's signature issue is immigration , especially illegal immigration , and in particular building or expanding a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico . As of October 2016 , Trump 's campaign had posted fourteen categories of policy proposals on his website , which have been since removed . During October 2016 , Trump outlined a series of steps for his first 100 days in office . Trump 's political positions , and his descriptions of his beliefs , have frequently changed . Politico has described his positions as \" eclectic , improvisational and often contradictory . \" According to an NBC News count , over the course of his campaign Trump made \" 141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues . \" Fact - checking organizations reported that during the campaign , Trump made a record number of false statements and lies compared to other candidates , a pattern that continued once in office .

      "Lumia imaging apps are imaging applications by Microsoft Mobile and formerly by Nokia for Lumia devices built on the technology of Scalado ( except for Lumia Panorama which was developed earlier by Nokia originally for Symbian and MeeGo devices ) . The Lumia imaging applications were notably all branded with \" Nokia \" in front of their names , but after Microsoft acquired Nokia 's devices and services business the Nokia branding was superseded with \" Lumia \" , and often updates included nothing but name changes , but for the Lumia Camera this included a new wide range of feature additions . Most of the imaging applications are developed by the Microsoft Lund division . As part of the release of Windows 10 Mobile and the integration of Lumia imaging features into the Windows Camera and Microsoft Photos applications some of these applications stopped working in October 2015 .

      "\" The Killers \" is a short - story by Charles Bukowski collected in his 1973 collection South of No North , originally published by John Martin 's Black Sparrow Press . The story elucidates Bukowski 's publicly acknowledged artistic debt to Ernest Hemingway , the writer who had the most influence on American writers of Bukowksi 's generation . Like \" The Killers \" , Bukowski 's story of the same name has as its thematic trope Murder in a nihilistic universe . Unlike Hemingway , the killers actually accomplish their act in the time - frame of the story . Bukowski 's authorial point of view in his version of \" The Killers \" also is influenced by Hemingway , as he it be seen as a logical outgrowth of the attitude expressed by Hemingway 's fictional alter - ego Nick Adams at the end of the 1927 \" Killers \" : Bukowski 's fiction is full of attempts to escape the Los Angeles of his childhood and teen - years , all of which are doomed to failure as his fictional alter - ego , Henry Chinaski , finds the same appalling corruption everywhere he travels . In Bukowski 's \" The Killers \" , there is no escape for the murderers who are the protagonists of the story , mirroring the doomed boxer Ole Andreson in Hemingway 's original . ": {

From that time , the Communist Party started a campaign of secularisation , seeking to transform the country into an atheistic state along Marxist - Leninist lines . Beginning with the 1989 revolution , the legally recognized churches , especially the Romanian Orthodox Church , the country \u2019s largest religious group , pressured the post - communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools , offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals , elderly care homes and prisons . Although education was an area where churches registered success in the early stages of post - communist transition , religious education remains a low priority in Romania . ": {

Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . After leaving Afghanistan , he worked in the U.S. for Voice of America . After living in Montreal , Sabet returned to Afghanistan to work for a human rights organization , before being appointed special adviser at the Interior Ministry . He was promoted to Attorney General in May 2006 . Sources close to the President Hamid Karzai say that Sabet was promoted with U.S. support in exchange for giving positive comments about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility . He has however been critical of the Guantanamo release policy . A series of articles on former Guantanamo captives , published by the McClatchy News Service , quoted Sabet commenting that the release of Guantanamo captives seemed to be divorced from the captives ' role in the Taliban , and to be focussed largely on whether the captives complied with the camp rules . In April 2007 , Sabet launched a violent raid on Tolo TV ( the country 's largest private TV chain ) for what he thought was a \" distorted \" report on his comments regarding the country 's judicial system . Seven journalists from the TV station were taken to his office by force without warrants and severely beaten . ": {

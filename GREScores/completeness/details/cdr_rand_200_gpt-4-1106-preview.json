      "Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users .|INTRODUCTION : The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction .|The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Three groups , comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN ) , 30 occasional cocaine ( OC ) , and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC ) users , were compared .|An emotional facial expression ( EFE ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surprise , sadness , anger , fear , and disgust ) was administered .|Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived .|Participants were also assessed with the \" Eyes task \" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology .|RESULTS : There were no group differences in psychopathology or \" eyes task \" performance , but the RC group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group , exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups .|The RC group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surprise , more slowly than CN , but not OC participants .|The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust .|The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group can not be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine , or ecstasy , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired .|Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": {

      "Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs .|The effects of i . v .|bolus administration of cromakalim ( 1 - 10 micrograms / kg ) and pinacidil ( 3 - 100 micrograms / kg ) on large ( circumflex artery ) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0 . 03 - 10 micrograms / kg ) .|Nitroglycerin , up to 0 . 3 micrograms / kg , selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( CxAD ) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter .|In contrast , cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0 . 3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose - dependently increased CxAD , coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure .|Cromakalim was approximately 8 - to 9 . 5 - fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD .|Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug - induced tachycardia was abolished .|When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant , the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim ( 10 micrograms / kg ) , pinacidil ( 30 micrograms / kg ) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg ) were reduced by 68 + / - 7 , 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1 % , respectively .|Thus , whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow - independently dilates large coronary arteries , cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors - mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand .|Finally , two mechanisms at least , direct vasodilation and flow dependency , are involved in the cromakalim - and pinacidil - induced increase in CxAD .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "Prevention of etomidate - induced myoclonus : which is superior : Fentanyl , midazolam , or a combination ? A Retrospective comparative study .|BACKGROUND : In this retrospective comparative study , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl , midazolam , and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate - induced myoclonus .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : This study was performed based on anesthesia records .|Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate , the patients were separated into 4 groups : no pretreatment ( Group NP ) , fentanyl 1 ug . kg - 1 ( Group F ) , midazolam 0 . 03 mg . kg - 1 ( Group M ) , and midazolam 0 . 015 mg . kg - 1 + fentanyl 0 . 5 ug . kg - 1 ( Group FM ) .|Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected : 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs , anesthesia is induced with 0 . 3 mg . kg - 1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20 - 30 seconds .|Myoclonic movements are evaluated , which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection .|The severity of pain due to etomidate injection , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , and adverse effects were also evaluated .|RESULTS : Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85 % , 40 % , 70 % , and 25 % in Group NP , Group F , Group M , and Group FM , respectively , and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM .|CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate - induced myoclonus .": {

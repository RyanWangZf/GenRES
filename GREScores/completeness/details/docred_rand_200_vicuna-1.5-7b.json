The film documents an old drifter in Paris in the poetic realist style . Jessua was inspired by Jean - Paul Cl\u00e9bert 's book Paris Insolite ( 1952 ) and decided to make a film about a clochard or tramp . The poet and novelist Robert Giraud , an expert on the Parisian underworld , introduced Jessua to L\u00e9on la Lune , a vagrant whose real name was Leon Boudeville , and suggested that they follow him from day to night . After completing the film Giraud showed it to the poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr\u00e9vert who wrote an introduction and asked Henri Crolla to contribute some music to the film . L\u00e9on la lune also appeared in the series Clochards by Robert Doisneau , the pioneer of humanist photojournalism . ": {

      "Tomcats Screaming Outside is the first ( and to date only ) solo album from British musician Roland Orzabal of the group Tears for Fears , and was released on 2 April 2001 . Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s ( following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith ) , this was the first recording to be released under his own name . This album was Orzabal 's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths , who co - wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums . The album was given a low - key release and did not chart , but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum ' n bass , ambient techno and trip hop textures . Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com 's editorial review : \" Solo album or not , Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade . \" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album : \" I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach , with drum and bass / jungle ... and I ended up with something that was n't the original plan . \" The US release of the album ( on Gold Circle Records ) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11 , 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst - ever terrorist attack , and drew little notice outside TFF 's core fan base .

      "The Young Wild Things Tour was a four - band fall 2007 arena concert tour by Fall Out Boy with supporting acts Gym Class Heroes , Plain White T 's , Cute Is What We Aim For , and Doug ( from November 9 on ) . This is Fall Out Boy 's biggest tour to date , grossing over $ 30 million . The tour sold out in five hours , with over 1.5 million tickets sold . The tour was first announced on the Fall Out Boy website , but instead of the traditional method of announcing tour dates in the same release as the announcement of the tour itself , the bands chose an unusual method . Fans would text a certain number and would be given a code for their state / area . That code would then be entered on a website . After an unknown amount of codes were entered , the tour date would be unlocked . The 31-date tour was only held in America , except for two Canadian dates . The tour began on October 18 and ran through December 2 . Inspired by Maurice Sendak 's 1963 children 's book Where the Wild Things Are , the concert tour included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi , containing images from the book . Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz explained , \" Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative . It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written : You know , tantrums and monster islands and all . \" \" There 's also a play on words of the young wild thing idea that everybody has with Hollywood and starlets right now . \" ": {

Until 2011 , the group consisted of eight voices : two sopranos , two altos , two tenors and two basses . The French group performed and recorded typically with only a double bass and drums as accompaniment . In 1973 , the original French group disbanded and Ward Swingle moved to London and hired members who debuted as Swingle II . The current group performs primarily a cappella . The group later performed and recorded under the name The Swingles , then The New Swingle Singers and The Swingle Singers before settling on The Swingles . The group has never disbanded . As individual members have left the group , remaining members have held auditions for replacements . ": {

      "Henry Wager Halleck ( January 16 , 1815 \u2013 January 9 , 1872 ) was a United States Army officer , scholar , and lawyer . A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : \" Old Brains . \" He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . Halleck served as General - in - Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general - in - chief of all U.S. armies . Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action . He was a master of administration , logistics , and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy , but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington , D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions . President Abraham Lincoln once described him as \" little more than a first rate clerk . \" In March 1864 , Grant was promoted to general - in - chief , and Halleck was relegated to chief - of - staff . Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies , Halleck performed capably in this task , ensuring that the Union armies were well - equipped . ": {

      "\" The Murders in the Rue Morgue \" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham 's Magazine in 1841 . It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his \" tales of ratiocination \" . C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women . Numerous witnesses heard a suspect , though no one agrees on what language was spoken . At the murder scene , Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human . As the first fictional detective , Poe 's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives , including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot . Many later characters , for example , follow Poe 's model of the brilliant detective , his personal friend who serves as narrator , and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it . Dupin himself reappears in \" The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat \" and \" The Purloined Letter \" . ": {

It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main political prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security , the Stasi . Unlike many other government and military institutions in East Germany , Hohensch\u00f6nhausen prison was not stormed by demonstrators after the fall of the Berlin Wall , allowing prison authorities to destroy evidence of the prison 's functions and history . Because of this , today 's knowledge of the functioning of the prison comes mainly from eye - witness accounts and documents sourced from other East German institutions . The prison was depicted in the 2006 film The Lives of Others , and in 2017 TV series The Same Sky . It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience . ": {

      "Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball , and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League . In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . It is composed of 30 teams . The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . Originally , three drafts were held each year . The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues . The August draft was eliminated after two years , and the January draft lasted until 1986 . The draft order is determined based on the previous season 's standings , with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick . In addition , teams that lost free agents in the previous off - season may be awarded \" compensatory \" picks . ": {

      "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

      "The Sims class destroyers were built for the United States Navy , and commissioned in 1939 and 1940 . These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II . All Sims - class ships saw action in World War II , and seven survived the war . No ship of this class saw service after 1946 . They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty , in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted , but an overall limit remained . Thus , to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all - new design , the Sims class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers . They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the Farragut class in 1932 . The class served extensively in World War II , and five of the class were lost in the war . Of the five ships lost , four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans . The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940 - 41 . Except for Roe , Wainwright , and Buck , the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor . All of the ships saw extensive combat service . At the war 's end in August 1945 , three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished , and were ultimately scrapped . The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll . One was sunk by the first blast , while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms . ": {

      "The French Resistance ( ) was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime during the Second World War . Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women ( called the Maquis in rural areas ) , who , in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities , were also publishers of underground newspapers , providers of first - hand intelligence information , and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines . The men and women of the Resistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society , including \u00e9migr\u00e9s , academics , students , aristocrats , conservative Roman Catholics ( including priests ) , and also citizens from the ranks of liberals , anarchists and communists . The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 , and the lesser - known invasion of Provence on 15 August , by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle . The Resistance also planned , coordinated , and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid , transport facilities , and telecommunications networks . It was also politically and morally important to France , both during the German occupation and for decades afterward , because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative , countering an existential threat to French nationhood . The actions of the Resistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy , the French people who joined the pro - Nazi Milice fran\u00e7aise and the French men who joined the Waffen SS . After the landings in Normandy and Provence , the paramilitary components of the Resistance were organised more formally , into a hierarchy of operational units known , collectively , as the French Forces of the Interior ( FFI ) . Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944 , the FFI grew rapidly and reached approximately 400,000 by October of that year . Although the amalgamation of the FFI was , in some cases , fraught with political difficulties , it was ultimately successful , and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth - largest army in the European theatre ( 1.2 million men ) by VE Day in May 1945 .

However , the Jesuit constitutions include provision for a resignation . In October 2016 the thirty - sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus appointed his successor , Arturo Sosa from Venezuela . ": {

      "Operator Toll Dialing was a project and method used by the Bell System in the USA and Canada to automate the switching and billing of long distance calls in the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . The program was initiated by 1945 , at which time ca . 5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method . Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices . Initially this system involved step - by - step routings to set up each circuit , but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network . The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 . In 1947 , the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up . Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing ( DDD ) , in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number . Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis , it was not fully implemented until the 1970s . Telephone administrations in other countries implemented similar programs , such as in the United Kingdom , which led to Subscriber Trunk Dialling ( STD ) . ": {

      "\" Ne crois pas \" ( , Do n't believe ) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Mich\u00e8le Arnaud . It was the first of two Luxembourgish entry in the contest and was performed in French . In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest , the song is an up - tempo number , with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless . She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that , as for the rest of humanity , he will lose his hair , gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well . Thus , she tells him that he should \" take advantage of it \" , rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time . The song was performed sixth on the night ( following France 's Math\u00e9 Alt\u00e9ry with \" Le temps perdu \" and preceding Italy 's Franca Raimondi with \" Aprite le finestre \" ) . As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released , definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make , however the song did not win . The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with \" Les amants de minuit \" and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Dani\u00e8le Dupr\u00e9 with \" Amours mortes ( tant de peine ) \" .

The ninth Disney Princess , Tiana is the first to be of African - American heritage . Tiana has been mostly positively received , with critics praising her personality and values . However , the depiction of Tiana and her community has been criticized for lacking \" emphasis on racial issues \" . The decision to depict the two main characters , Tiana and Naveen , as frogs for the majority of the movie has also caused controversy , with some saying that it is equating people of color to animals .

This company was incorporated on 4 January 1926 to build and operate a local assembly plant , General Motors ' first owned not leased overseas plant . Its popular cars , including British Vauxhalls , remained common household brands until well after the second World War . Postwar British sourced Vauxhalls continued to keep the plant running together with limited numbers ( restricted by currency shortages ) of Chevrolets . In the late 1950s the Vauxhall and the now expansive Chevrolet and Pontiac cars began to be replaced with Australian sourced Holden vehicles supplemented by the smallest Vauxhalls and Holdens and the move to the Holden brand was completed in the 1970s . The assembly of vehicles ended in 1990 and since then the business has been distribution of complete imported vehicles and spare parts . ": {

      "Matagorda Bay ( ) is a large Gulf of Mexico estuary bay on the Texas coast , lying in Calhoun and Matagorda counties and located approximately northeast of Corpus Christi , east - southeast of San Antonio , south - southwest of Houston , and south - southeast of Austin . It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Matagorda Peninsula and serves as the mouth of numerous streams , most notably the Lavaca and Colorado Rivers . The Texas seaport of Port Lavaca is located on the system 's northwestern extension of Lavaca Bay . The city of Palacios is found on northeastern extension of Tres Palacios Bay , and Port O'Connor is located on the southwestern tip of the main bay 's shore . The ghost town of Indianola , which was a major port before it was destroyed by two hurricanes in the late 19th Century , is also found on the bay . The bay 's shore , especially near the Colorado River delta , provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife . The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism , and is an essential component of the production of seafood , specifically shrimp and blue crab , which are the specialties of the area . The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming , especially for the propagation of rice . ": {

      "\" Teardrops \" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1981 album Somewhere in England . It was also issued as the second single off the album , in July 1981 . As with the lead single , \" All Those Years Ago \" , Harrison completed the song after Warner Bros. Records had rejected his initial submission of Somewhere in England in September 1980 . In response to Warner 's concerns , he wrote \" Teardrops \" as an attempt at a commercially oriented song . Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in England with Ray Cooper as his co - producer . Despite some reviewers predicting it as a hit , the single failed to achieve commercial success . In the United States , it peaked at number 102 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and number 88 on the Cash Box Top 100 . ": {

      "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .

The lake and park have a fishing dock , wading pool , tennis courts , and softball diamonds . There is a recreation center that hosts activities . The lake borders a municipal golf course . In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks . There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls . Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows , and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River . Friends of Lake Hiawatha is a community environmental action group that organizes volunteer efforts to clean the lake and park . ": {

      "The Old Loggers Path ( OLP ) is a loop hiking trail in Lycoming County in north - central Pennsylvania in the United States . Marked with international orange blazes , the Old Loggers Path is located entirely within the Loyalsock State Forest . Most hikers take two and a half to three days and two nights to complete the Old Loggers Path , making it popular for weekend hikes . Highlights of the trail include waterfalls , several scenic streams and creeks ( most of which do not have bridges ) , and panoramic vistas . The land the Old Loggers Path is on was initially owned and clear - cut by the Union Tanning Company , followed by the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company . The trail chiefly follows the grades of abandoned logging roads and railroads , and its trailhead is the lumber ghost town of Masten . Parts of the trail were made by the Civilian Conservation Corps , which operated a camp in the area from 1933 to 1941 . ": {

      "Piracy on Falcon Lake refers to an increase in crime at the border between the United States and Mexico on Falcon Lake . The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route . A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast . The so - called pirates operate \" fleets \" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs . While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy , all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .

      "Municipal elections in Canada fall within the jurisdiction of the various provinces and territories , who usually hold their municipal elections on the same date every two , three or four years , depending on the location . Each province has its own nomenclature for municipalities and some have local elections for unincorporated areas which are not technically municipalities . These entities can be called cities , towns , villages , townships , hamlets , parishes and , simply , municipalities , county municipalities , regional county municipalities , municipal districts , regional districts , counties , regional municipalities , specialized municipalities , district municipalities or rural municipalities . Many of these may be used by Statistics Canada as the basis for census divisions or census subdivisions . Municipal elections usually elect a mayor and city council and often also a school board . Some locations may also elect other bodies , such as Vancouver , which elects its own parks board . Some municipalities will also hold referenda or ballot initiatives at the same time , usually relating to spending projects or tax changes . Elections for city councils are held through either a ward system or at - large system , depending on the location . Vancouver is the largest city in Canada to use the at - large system , while most other larger cities use wards . Most councils are non - partisan and elect only independents . However , some municipalities have locally based political parties or election slates . These include Montreal , Quebec City and Longueuil in Quebec and Vancouver , Victoria , Surrey and Richmond in British Columbia . These local parties are rarely affiliated with any provincial or federal parties . Voting may be done with paper ballots that are hand - counted , or by various forms of electronic voting . ": {

      "CBBC ( short for Children 's BBC ) is a British children 's television strand owned by the BBC and aimed for children aged from 6 to 12 . BBC programming aimed at under six year old children is broadcast on the CBeebies channel . CBBC broadcasts from 7 \u00a0 am to 9 \u00a0 pm on the digital CBBC Channel , available on most UK digital platforms . The CBBC brand was used for the broadcast of children 's programmes on BBC One on weekday afternoons and on BBC Two mornings until these strands were phased out in 2012 and 2013 respectively , as part of the BBC 's \" Delivering Quality First \" cost - cutting initiative . CBBC programmes were also broadcast in high definition alongside other BBC content on BBC HD , generally at afternoons on weekends , unless the channel was covering other events . This ended when BBC HD closed on 26 March 2013 , but CBBC HD launched on 10 December 2013 . BBC - produced children 's programming , in native languages of Scotland and Wales , also airs on BBC Alba and S4C respectively . ": {

      "Georg Riedel ( born 8 January 1934 ) is a Swedish double bass player and composer . Riedel migrated to Sweden at the age of four and attended school in Stockholm , including the Adolf Fredrik 's Music School . The best known recording featuring Riedel is probably Jan Johansson 's Jazz p\u00e5 svenska ( \" Jazz in Swedish \" ) , a minimalist - jazz compilation of folk songs recorded in 1962\u20131963 , though Riedel has recorded with other leading Swedish musicians including trumpeter Jan Allan and Arne Domn\u00e9rus . Riedel 's profile as a composer derives almost exclusively from writing music for Astrid Lindgren movies , including the main theme from the Emil i L\u00f6nneberga ( \" Emil of Maple Hills \" ) movies . He also composed the music for several films by Arne Mattsson in the 1960s as well as for film adaptions of novels by Stig Dagerman . Riedel also played on Jazz at the Pawnshop in 1977 . ": {

      "Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys . It began far back in prehistory . The earliest surviving iron artifacts , from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt , were made from meteoritic iron - nickel . It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began , but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub - Saharan Africa to China . The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore . ": {

In the case of others such as the Mackenzie , it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries , as noted . Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less . Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi , the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do . Nine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them . Four \u2014 the Yukon , Columbia , Porcupine , and Kootenay \u2014 begin in Canada and flow into the United States . Five \u2014 the Milk , Pend d'Oreille , Saint Lawrence , Red , and Saint John \u2014 begin in the United States and flow into Canada . Of these , the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice , the Milk leaving and then re - entering the United States , the Kootenay leaving and then re - entering Canada . The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries ; in addition , the drainage basins of six others \u2014 the Fraser , Assiniboine , South Saskatchewan , Saskatchewan , Nelson , and Winnipeg \u2014 extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada . Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision . Biologist and author Ruth Patrick , describing a table of high - discharge rivers , wrote that data on discharge , drainage area , and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted . \" It seems , \" she said , \" that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers , and not to place too much importance on minor ( 10\u201320 % ) differences in figures . \" ": {

      "The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10 , 1260 , between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt , in Syria . After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260 , Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge , thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria . However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year . ": {

      "The is a subregion of the Ch\u016bbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean . The name comes from the T\u014dkaid\u014d , one of the Edo Five Routes . Because T\u014dkai is a sub - region and is not officially classified , there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends , however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka , Aichi , Gifu and Mie prefectures . The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area ( Nagoya Metropolitan Area ) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan 's third strongest economy . The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi , Gifu , and Mie ; this area is sometimes referred to as the Ch\u016bky\u014d region . T\u014dkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan . Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories . The T\u014dkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past , including the two great earthquakes in 1944 ( also known as the \" Tonankai earthquake \" ) and 1945 ( also known as the \" Mikawa earthquake \" ) . Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi , it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future . Nagoya , Shizuoka , and other large cities would be greatly damaged , with potential casualties in the tens of thousands . The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970 , and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974 . ": {

In his preface Wittig writes : I 've often been asked how you go about it to invent a game . I want to add one answer now . Is perhaps the best answer possible to show the many different ways of designing a game . The answer is also a challenge : Invent rules of your own to my dice pyramid . The first edition of the game was a small version of the dice pyramid , without any rules . Over time , players contributed their own rules to a collection . ": {

After acting in several of Jacques Demy \u2019s films , including A Slightly Pregnant Man and La Naissance du Jour , Marshall cites to have taken influence from his direction in the sense of creating whimsical atmospheres and rooting the stories with more of a female - centric narrative . In her most notable film , Venus Beauty Institute , Marshall \u2019s touched on the theme of finding love from a female perspective , and how it can fundamentally be more difficult because of how it strays from the traditional dynamic of courtship . She explains how \u201c in a practical sense , it \u2019s complicated to have abandon [ oneself ] into a man \u2019s arms and , at the same time , stay very tough because you have to work \u2026 \u201d .

      "Andrew Stuart Fastow ( born December 22 , 1961 ) is a convicted criminal and businessman who was the chief financial officer of Enron Corporation , an energy trading company based in Houston , Texas , until he was fired shortly before the company declared bankruptcy . Fastow was one of the key figures behind the complex web of off - balance - sheet special purpose entities ( limited partnerships which Enron controlled ) used to conceal Enron 's massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets . By unlawfully maintaining personal stakes in these ostensibly independent ghost - entities , he was able to defraud Enron out of tens of millions of dollars . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently opened an investigation into his and the company 's conduct in 2001 . Fastow served a six - year prison sentence for charges related to these acts . His wife , Lea Weingarten , also worked at Enron , where she was an assistant treasurer ; she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud , money laundering conspiracy and filing fraudulent income tax returns , and served jail time before early release to a halfway house .

      "Arcadia were a new wave British group formed in 1985 by Simon Le Bon , Nick Rhodes , and Roger Taylor of Duran Duran as a side project during a break in that band 's schedule . The project was only active during 1985 and 1986 for just one album , So Red the Rose , which was certified Platinum in the United States and included the singles \" Election Day \" , \" Goodbye Is Forever \" , \" The Flame \" and \" The Promise ( ft . David Gilmour and Sting ) \" . Drummer Roger Taylor appeared in only a few band photographs and in none of the music videos , and stated he was only to be involved in the recording side of the project ( he also had minor involvement in The Power Station , the other Duran Duran splinter group formed by Duran Duran 's Andy and John Taylor alongside Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson of Chic ) . The name of the band was reportedly inspired by the Nicolas Poussin painting Et in Arcadia ego ( also known as \" The Arcadian Shepherds \" ) . ": {

      "America 's Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love , released worldwide on February 10 , 2004 by Virgin Records . Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) . The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she \" just wanted to be in a ch\u00e2teau for six months and do drugs . \" The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing . Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , \" Mono , \" and Love 's highly publicised drug issues . America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as \" a mistake . \" In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as \" le disaster \" and \" ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , \" respectively . The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn . ": {

      "The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum ( ) was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia , Bulgaria , from 1949 to 1999 . The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria 's first Communist leader , Georgi Dimitrov ( 1882 \u2013 1949 ) , construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov 's death . It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third . The fourth ( and successful ) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive , less powerful explosions . ": {

      "Auguste Dreyfus ( 28 June 1827 \u2013 25 May 1897 ) was a French businessman who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in guano . Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima , Peru to act as their local representative . He became involved in the guano trade , and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe . With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income . The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction . The government ran into increasing financial difficulties . These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano - producing province . A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile . The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end . He retired to France , where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art . ": {

German colonial forces withdrew from the capital Lom\u00e9 and the coastal province , to fight delaying actions on the route north to Kamina , where the Kamina Funkstation ( wireless transmitter ) linked the government in Berlin to Togoland , the Atlantic and South America . The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of Gold Coast and Dahomey , advanced from the coast up the road and railway , as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north . The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914 . In 1916 , Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922 , British Togoland and French Togoland were established as League of Nations mandates . ": {

      "Andrea Lilio ( 1555 - 1642 ) was an Italian painter born in Ancona , hence he also is known as L'Anconitano . He painted mainly in his native city , as well as in Rome , where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640 . He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano . In the latter , he painted , Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent . Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci , Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences . In fact , it is altogether possible that Lilio collaborated for the illustrations of Cesare Ripa 's Iconologia , which was a popular source for such motifs for a very long time . He died at Ascoli Piceno . In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova , he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven . He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII . One of his masterpieces , the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence , was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona .

      "\" The Killers \" is a short - story by Charles Bukowski collected in his 1973 collection South of No North , originally published by John Martin 's Black Sparrow Press . The story elucidates Bukowski 's publicly acknowledged artistic debt to Ernest Hemingway , the writer who had the most influence on American writers of Bukowksi 's generation . Like \" The Killers \" , Bukowski 's story of the same name has as its thematic trope Murder in a nihilistic universe . Unlike Hemingway , the killers actually accomplish their act in the time - frame of the story . Bukowski 's authorial point of view in his version of \" The Killers \" also is influenced by Hemingway , as he it be seen as a logical outgrowth of the attitude expressed by Hemingway 's fictional alter - ego Nick Adams at the end of the 1927 \" Killers \" : Bukowski 's fiction is full of attempts to escape the Los Angeles of his childhood and teen - years , all of which are doomed to failure as his fictional alter - ego , Henry Chinaski , finds the same appalling corruption everywhere he travels . In Bukowski 's \" The Killers \" , there is no escape for the murderers who are the protagonists of the story , mirroring the doomed boxer Ole Andreson in Hemingway 's original . ": {

      "Raetia was the name of a canton of the Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1803 , corresponding to modern Graub\u00fcnden and composed of the Free State of the Three Leagues . Until 1799 , the canton was administered by the central government of the Helvetic Republic . The districts of Chiavenna , Valtellina and Bormio , previously dependencies of the Leagues , were never a part of the canton , having permanently been detached from the Leagues after Revolutionary France fomented revolt there , leading them to be annexed to the Cisalpine Republic on October 10 , 1797 . The districts subsequently joined the Austrian client kingdom of Lombardy - Venetia after the Congress of Vienna and eventually become the Italian province of Sondrio .

      "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .

      "Emiliano Esono Mich\u00e1 is an Equatoguinean political activist currently imprisoned on weapons possession charges . His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International , the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience . Mich\u00e1 was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea ( PPGE ) , a banned political party opposing the long - dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea . In late March 2008 , he was arrested without a warrant . Within a week , fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele , Gumersindo Ram\u00edrez Faustino , Juan Ecomo Ndong , Gerardo Ang\u00fce Mangue , and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested . Mich\u00e1 was held for two months at the police station , turning which time he was allegedly tortured . In May 2008 , the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist , Saturnino Ncogo . Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances . Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide , but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition , and no investigation was ever conducted . According to Amnesty International , the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo 's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition , the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them . Despite being charged with unrelated crimes , the six were tried alongside Simon Mann , a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt . The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece . The US State Department considers Mich\u00e1 a political prisoner , and has objected to his continued imprisonment . Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience , and has called for his immediate release . ": {

The most visible ambassadorships are often distributed either in this way or to the President 's ideological or partisan confreres . Most ambassadorships , however , are assigned to Foreign Service Officers who have spent their career in the State Department . Regardless , all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate . While all ambassadors serve at the president 's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time , career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment , and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president .

      "Glandularia , common name mock vervain or mock verbena , is a genus of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae . They are native to the Americas . Glandularia species are closely related to the true vervains and sometimes still included with them in Verbena . Horizontal chloroplast transfer occurred at least twice and possibly three times between these genera , which are otherwise too distinct to warrant unification . The discovery of the signal in the chloroplast genome was announced in 2008 by researchers from the University of Washington . Somehow , chloroplasts from V. \u00a0 orcuttiana , swamp verbena ( V. \u00a0 hastata ) or a close relative of these had admixed into the G. \u00a0 bipinnatifida genome . Although hybridization runs rampant in the true and mock vervains \u2013 the ancestors of the well - known garden vervain are quite obscure \u2013 it does not seem to have been the cause of the cross - species gene transfer . In addition , the researchers discovered the signal of one more transfer event . This had introduced chloroplasts from an ancestral member of the Verbena lineage nowadays found in South America into Glandularia . Although all members of the present genus can be distinguished to have a chromosome count of five , the South American species are diploid , while polyploid hybrid Glandularia are very widespread from northern Central America northwards . The second genetic introgression must have occurred before the genus spread north , as species with the Verbena - like chloroplasts are found all over the Americas . Since the new chloroplast genes replaced the old ones , it may be that the possibly hybridogenic G. \u00a0 bipinnatifida actually underwent horizontal chloroplast transfer twice in its evolutionary history .

      "Abdul Jabar Sabet is an Afghan politician . In May 2006 Hamid Karzai appointed him Attorney General of Afghanistan . Sabet is an ethnic Pashtun . Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . After leaving Afghanistan , he worked in the U.S. for Voice of America . After living in Montreal , Sabet returned to Afghanistan to work for a human rights organization , before being appointed special adviser at the Interior Ministry . He was promoted to Attorney General in May 2006 . Sources close to the President Hamid Karzai say that Sabet was promoted with U.S. support in exchange for giving positive comments about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility . He has however been critical of the Guantanamo release policy . A series of articles on former Guantanamo captives , published by the McClatchy News Service , quoted Sabet commenting that the release of Guantanamo captives seemed to be divorced from the captives ' role in the Taliban , and to be focussed largely on whether the captives complied with the camp rules . In April 2007 , Sabet launched a violent raid on Tolo TV ( the country 's largest private TV chain ) for what he thought was a \" distorted \" report on his comments regarding the country 's judicial system . Seven journalists from the TV station were taken to his office by force without warrants and severely beaten . ": {

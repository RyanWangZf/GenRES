      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "Factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|BACKGROUND AND AIM : Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia .|This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|METHODS : Eighty - eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon - alpha - 2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study .|A hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g / dL was defined as ribavirin - induced anemia .|RESULTS : Ribavirin - induced anemia occurred in 18 ( 20 . 5 % ) patients during treatment .|A 2 g / dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment .|The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or = 2 g / dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with < 2 g / dL decrease ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|Such factors as sex ( female ) , age ( > or = 60 years old ) , and the ribavirin dose by body weight ( 12 mg / kg or more ) were significant by univariate analysis .|CONCLUSIONS : Careful administration is necessary in patients > or = 60 years old , in female patients , and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg / kg or more .|Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g / dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation in neurocritical care patients .|OBJECTIVE : Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations .|However , both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects .|The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol .|DESIGN : Multicenter , retrospective , propensity - matched cohort study .|SETTING : Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board - certified neurointensivists .|PATIENTS : Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1 : 1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics .|INTERVENTIONS : Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol .|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : A total of 342 patients ( 105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol ) were included in the analysis , with 190 matched ( 95 in each group ) by propensity score .|The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg ) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 beats / min ) during sedative infusion .|No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched ( 30 % vs 30 % , p = 0 . 94 ) or matched cohorts ( 28 % vs 34 % , p = 0 . 35 ) could be found .|When analyzed separately , no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts .|CONCLUSIONS : Severe hypotension and bradycardia occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive dexmedetomidine or propofol .|Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of hypotension or bradycardia before starting either sedative .": {

      "Blockade of endothelial - mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin - induced diabetic nephropathy .|OBJECTIVE : A multicenter , controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin - angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy , suggesting that other mechanism ( s ) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy ( diabetic nephropathy ) .|We have previously demonstrated that endothelial - mesenchymal - transition ( EndoMT ) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetes .|In the present study , we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy .|RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line ( MMEC ) in the presence of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) and in the endothelial lineage - traceble mouse line Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP by administration of AGEs , with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control .|Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation / Western blotting and confocal microscopy .|Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3 ) were performed in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .|RESULTS : Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2 - Cre ; Loxp - EGFP mice .|Immunoprecipitation / Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy .|Confocal microscopy and real - time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT , reduced renal fibrosis , and retarded progression of nephropathy .|CONCLUSIONS : EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy .|Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications .": {

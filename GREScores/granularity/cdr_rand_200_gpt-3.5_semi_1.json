      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Efficacy and safety of granisetron , a selective 5 - hydroxytryptamine - 3 receptor antagonist , in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high - dose cisplatin .|PURPOSE : To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron ( Kytril ; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals , Philadelphia , PA ) when administered as a single intravenous ( IV ) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin - induced nausea and vomiting .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : One hundred eighty - four chemotherapy - naive patients receiving high - dose cisplatin ( 81 to 120 mg / m2 ) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses ( 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 micrograms / kg ) administered before chemotherapy .|Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours , and vital signs , nausea , vomiting , retching , and appetite were assessed .|Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes .|RESULTS : After granisetron doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 micrograms / kg , a major response ( < or = two vomiting or retching episodes , and no antiemetic rescue ) was recorded in 23 % , 57 % , 58 % , and 60 % of patients , respectively , and a complete response ( no vomiting or retching , and no antiemetic rescue ) in 18 % , 41 % , 40 % , and 47 % of patients , respectively .|There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea ( P = . 0015 ) and vomiting ( P = . 0001 ) , and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10 - micrograms / kg dosing groups than in the 5 - micrograms / kg dosing group .|As granisetron dose increased , appetite return increased ( P = . 040 ) .|Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event ( 20 % ) .|CONCLUSION : A single 10 - , 20 - , or 40 - micrograms / kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57 % to 60 % of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg / m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40 % to 47 % of patients .|There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10 - micrograms / kg dose and the 20 - and 40 - micrograms / kg doses .|Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses .": {

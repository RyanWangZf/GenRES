      "A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation in neurocritical care patients .|OBJECTIVE : Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations .|However , both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects .|The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol .|DESIGN : Multicenter , retrospective , propensity - matched cohort study .|SETTING : Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board - certified neurointensivists .|PATIENTS : Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1 : 1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics .|INTERVENTIONS : Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol .|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : A total of 342 patients ( 105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol ) were included in the analysis , with 190 matched ( 95 in each group ) by propensity score .|The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg ) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 beats / min ) during sedative infusion .|No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched ( 30 % vs 30 % , p = 0 . 94 ) or matched cohorts ( 28 % vs 34 % , p = 0 . 35 ) could be found .|When analyzed separately , no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts .|CONCLUSIONS : Severe hypotension and bradycardia occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive dexmedetomidine or propofol .|Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of hypotension or bradycardia before starting either sedative .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "The effect of recombinant human insulin - like growth factor - I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats .|We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) nephropathy , an experimental model of glomerular disease .|Therefore , we examined whether recombinant human ( rh ) IGF - I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy .|The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk .|Experimental animals ( n = 6 ) received rhIGF - I , 400 micrograms / d , whereas control rats ( n = 6 ) received the vehicle .|rhIGF - I improved weight gain by 14 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) , without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease .|Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF - I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy .|After 12 wk , the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF - I - treated rats , 0 . 48 + / - 0 . 08 versus 0 . 24 + / - 0 . 06 mL / min / 100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals , p < 0 . 05 .|The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis , tubulointerstitial injury , or renal cortical malondialdehyde content .|In rats with PAN nephropathy , administration of rhIGF - I increased IGF - I and GH receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of IGF - I receptor mRNA .|In normal rats with intact kidneys , rhIGF - I administration ( n = 4 ) did not alter weight gain , blood pressure , proteinuria , GFR , glomerular planar area , renal cortical malondialdehyde content , or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage , compared with untreated animals ( n = 4 ) .|rhIGF - I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF - I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF - I or GH receptors .|We conclude that : 1 ) administration of rhIGF - I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2 ) unlike rhGH , long - term use of rhIGF - I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall .|BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .|The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations .|dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .|Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L .|Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .|Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .|An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .|Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

      "Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose .|BACKGROUND / AIMS : Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas / Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure .|The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure .|METHODOLOGY : Serum levels of sFas ( soluble Fas ) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects .|Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and interferon - gamma were also determined by ELISA .|RESULTS : Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26 . 8 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 52 . 7 U / mL ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8 . 6 U / mL ; range , 6 . 5 - 12 . 0 U / mL , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28 . 7 U / mL ; range , 12 . 8 - 52 . 7 U / mL , n = 17 ) than those due to non - A to E hepatitis ( median , 12 . 5 U / mL ; range , 6 . 9 - 46 . 0 U / mL , n = 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients .|A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0 . 613 , P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas - mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor - alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .": {

      "Drug - induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors .|BACKGROUND : Drug - induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction .|Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose - dependent manner .|In the inpatient setting , the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug - drug interactions remain unknown .|METHODS : We performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 - year period in a tertiary care hospital .|A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone .|In addition to methadone dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation .|RESULTS : Among 167 methadone maintenance patients , the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0 . 50 second ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) or longer was 16 . 2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjects .|Six patients ( 3 . 6 % ) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes .|QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient , 0 . 20 ; P < . 01 ) .|Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31 . 8 % of QTc variability to methadone dose , cytochrome P - 450 3A4 drug - drug interactions , hypokalemia , and altered liver function .|CONCLUSIONS : QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding .|Methadone dose , presence of cytochrome P - 450 3A4 inhibitors , potassium level , and liver function contribute to QT prolongation .|Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|BACKGROUND AND AIM : Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia .|This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin - induced anemia .|METHODS : Eighty - eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon - alpha - 2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study .|A hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g / dL was defined as ribavirin - induced anemia .|RESULTS : Ribavirin - induced anemia occurred in 18 ( 20 . 5 % ) patients during treatment .|A 2 g / dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment .|The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or = 2 g / dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with < 2 g / dL decrease ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|Such factors as sex ( female ) , age ( > or = 60 years old ) , and the ribavirin dose by body weight ( 12 mg / kg or more ) were significant by univariate analysis .|CONCLUSIONS : Careful administration is necessary in patients > or = 60 years old , in female patients , and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg / kg or more .|Patients who experience a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g / dL or more at week 2 after the start of treatment should be monitored with particular care .": {

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": {

      "Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low - risk patients with cocaine - associated chest pain .|BACKGROUND : Most patients presenting to emergency departments ( EDs ) with cocaine - associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a \" rule out acute coronary syndrome \" protocol , often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge .|In patients without cocaine use , coronary computerized tomography angiography ( CTA ) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged .|It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine - associated chest pain , as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia .|We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine - associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge .|METHODS : We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low - risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain ( self - reported or positive urine test ) .|Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED ( without serial markers ) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements .|Patients with negative coronary CTA ( maximal stenosis less than 50 % ) were discharged .|The main outcome was 30 - day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction .|RESULTS : A total of 59 patients with cocaine - associated chest pain were evaluated .|Patients had a mean age of 45 . 6 + / - 6 . 6 yrs and were 86 % black , 66 % male .|Seventy - nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85 % had a TIMI score < 2 .|Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED , 18 of whom were discharged following CTA ( 90 % ) .|Thirty - nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period , with 37 discharged home following CTA ( 95 % ) .|Six patients had coronary stenosis > or = 50 % .|During the 30 - day follow - up period , no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 0 % ; 95 % CI , 0 - 6 . 1 % ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Although cocaine - associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction , patients with cocaine associated chest pain , a non - ischemic ECG , and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30 - day adverse events .": {

      "Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus in the rat : immunohistochemical study of neurons , astrocytes and serum - protein extravasation .|The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity .|Additionally , in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra ( SNR ) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR .|In this study , status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats .|The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time - course of changes in neurons and astrocytes .|Animals surviving 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 min , 2 , 3 , 6 hours , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion - fixed , and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR .|Nissl - staining and antibodies against the neuron - specific calcium - binding protein , parvalbumin , served to detect neuronal damage in SNR .|Antibodies against the astroglia - specific cytoskeletal protein , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , and against the glial calcium - binding protein , S - 100 protein , were used to assess the status of astrocytes .|Immunohistochemical staining for serum - albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood - brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation .|Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP - staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects .|At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S - 100 protein staining .|By 2 hours , parvalbumin - staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage , and Nissl - staining visualized some neuronal distortion .|Staining for serum - proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours .|By 6 h , vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR .|By 24 h , glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR .|By 48 - 72 h , astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size , and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area .|In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days , conventional paraffin - sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR .|Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus .|Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR .|Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

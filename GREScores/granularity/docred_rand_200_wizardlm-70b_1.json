Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be , nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states ; because of this , the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source .

      "The Young Wild Things Tour was a four - band fall 2007 arena concert tour by Fall Out Boy with supporting acts Gym Class Heroes , Plain White T 's , Cute Is What We Aim For , and Doug ( from November 9 on ) . This is Fall Out Boy 's biggest tour to date , grossing over $ 30 million . The tour sold out in five hours , with over 1.5 million tickets sold . The tour was first announced on the Fall Out Boy website , but instead of the traditional method of announcing tour dates in the same release as the announcement of the tour itself , the bands chose an unusual method . Fans would text a certain number and would be given a code for their state / area . That code would then be entered on a website . After an unknown amount of codes were entered , the tour date would be unlocked . The 31-date tour was only held in America , except for two Canadian dates . The tour began on October 18 and ran through December 2 . Inspired by Maurice Sendak 's 1963 children 's book Where the Wild Things Are , the concert tour included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi , containing images from the book . Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz explained , \" Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative . It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written : You know , tantrums and monster islands and all . \" \" There 's also a play on words of the young wild thing idea that everybody has with Hollywood and starlets right now . \" ": {

      "\" The Murders in the Rue Morgue \" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham 's Magazine in 1841 . It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his \" tales of ratiocination \" . C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women . Numerous witnesses heard a suspect , though no one agrees on what language was spoken . At the murder scene , Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human . As the first fictional detective , Poe 's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives , including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot . Many later characters , for example , follow Poe 's model of the brilliant detective , his personal friend who serves as narrator , and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it . Dupin himself reappears in \" The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat \" and \" The Purloined Letter \" . ": {

Outside video games , the character appears in books and graphic novels\u2014 , , , and \u2014and has cameos in other Halo media , including , , The Halo Graphic Novel , Halo Legends and . The Master Chief is a towering biochemically and cybernetically - enhanced supersoldier , raised and trained from an early age to be a weapon ; he is almost faceless , never seen without his green - colored armor and helmet . He is commonly referred to by his naval rank , rather than his given birth - name or serial - designation . The character is voiced by Steve Downes , a Chicago disc jockey , in the video games in which he appears . Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood \u2013 type character of few words . The Master Chief is a video game icon , a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters , such as Mario , Sonic the Hedgehog and Lara Croft . The character has received a mostly positive reception . While some have described the Chief 's silent and faceless nature as a weakness of the character , other publications have suggested these attributes better allow players to assume his role . ": {

      "\" Bombtrack \" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self - titled debut album . Like most of Rage Against the Machine 's songs , the song 's lyrics discuss social inequality , proclaiming that \" landlords and power whores \" were going to \" burn \" . The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford . The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with \" Know Your Enemy \" and \" Fistful of Steel \" . Impressed by their song , Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ' , making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track ' . A music video was released , depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization , Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman . The video clip did not appear on the group 's first home video , citing Rage 's first altered political opinion . In 2003 , the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD . The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda 's famous image of Che Guevara , Guerrillero Heroico . A mirrored version of the iconic two - tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick ( T - shirt version ) . Perhaps the song 's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone 's controversial film Natural Born Killers , when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory .

      "\" Ne crois pas \" ( , Do n't believe ) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Mich\u00e8le Arnaud . It was the first of two Luxembourgish entry in the contest and was performed in French . In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest , the song is an up - tempo number , with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless . She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that , as for the rest of humanity , he will lose his hair , gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well . Thus , she tells him that he should \" take advantage of it \" , rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time . The song was performed sixth on the night ( following France 's Math\u00e9 Alt\u00e9ry with \" Le temps perdu \" and preceding Italy 's Franca Raimondi with \" Aprite le finestre \" ) . As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released , definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make , however the song did not win . The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with \" Les amants de minuit \" and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Dani\u00e8le Dupr\u00e9 with \" Amours mortes ( tant de peine ) \" .

In response to Warner 's concerns , he wrote \" Teardrops \" as an attempt at a commercially oriented song . Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in England with Ray Cooper as his co - producer . Despite some reviewers predicting it as a hit , the single failed to achieve commercial success .

The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route . A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast . The so - called pirates operate \" fleets \" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs . While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy , all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .

Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less . Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi , the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do .

      "The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10 , 1260 , between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt , in Syria . After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260 , Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge , thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria . However , the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant . The main cities of Syria , Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation . But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes . These princes , rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves , actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs . Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire , the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands . This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut . After quickly recapturing Aleppo , the force travelled southwards to Homs , but were decisively defeated . This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate , though there were several later incursions , none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year . ": {

      "The Committee against the Finnish White Terror ( ) was an organization in Sweden , formed at the end of the Finnish Civil War . The formation of the Committee was preceded by a call from the Social Democratic Left Party published in Politiken in February 1918 to mobilize protests around the country to counter the official Swedish government position on the Finnish question . The Committee sought to unite the Swedish labour movement for a common position against what they termed the \u201d White Terror \u201d in Finland . The Committee raised funds for humanitarian aid to the victims of the repression . The Committee also opposed denials of political asylum for Finnish refugees . Sven Linderot was one of the three members of the Committee . The Committee managed to gather 21,851.53 kronor , 14,518.73 for Finnish refugees in Sweden and 6,920 kronor for affected in Finland . The Committee published 100,000 leaflets titled ' Truth about Finland ' , and more than 100 public meetings were organized . ": {

      "The is a subregion of the Ch\u016bbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean . The name comes from the T\u014dkaid\u014d , one of the Edo Five Routes . Because T\u014dkai is a sub - region and is not officially classified , there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends , however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka , Aichi , Gifu and Mie prefectures . The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area ( Nagoya Metropolitan Area ) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan 's third strongest economy . The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi , Gifu , and Mie ; this area is sometimes referred to as the Ch\u016bky\u014d region . T\u014dkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan . Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories . The T\u014dkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past , including the two great earthquakes in 1944 ( also known as the \" Tonankai earthquake \" ) and 1945 ( also known as the \" Mikawa earthquake \" ) . Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi , it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future . Nagoya , Shizuoka , and other large cities would be greatly damaged , with potential casualties in the tens of thousands . The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970 , and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974 . ": {

The relationship between the Marine Band and the White House began on New Year 's Day 1801 , when President John Adams invited the band to perform at the Executive Mansion . Later that year , Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration . The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since . President Thomas Jefferson gave the title \" The President 's Own \" in 1801 . Today , the Marine Band performs in approximately 500 events every year including state funerals , state arrival ceremonies , state dinners , parades , concerts , and other social events .

      "Auguste Dreyfus ( 28 June 1827 \u2013 25 May 1897 ) was a French businessman who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in guano . Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima , Peru to act as their local representative . He became involved in the guano trade , and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe . With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income . The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction . The government ran into increasing financial difficulties . These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano - producing province . A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile . The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end . He retired to France , where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art . ": {

      "The Trail Smelter dispute was a trans - boundary pollution case involving the federal governments of both Canada and the United States , which eventually contributed to establishing the Harm principle in the environmental law of transboundary pollution . The smelter in Trail , British Columbia was historically operated by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company ( COMINCO ) until COMINCO merged with Teck in 2001 , and has processed lead and zinc since 1896 . Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada \u2013 US border in Washington . The smoke from the smelter distressed residents , resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation .

      "The Romanian Revolution of 1989 , which ended the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu in December 1989 , offered the 15 religious denominations then recognized in Romania the chance to regain the terrain lost after 1945 , the year when Dr. Petru Groza of the Ploughmen 's Front , a party closely associated with the Communists , became prime minister . From that time , the Communist Party started a campaign of secularisation , seeking to transform the country into an atheistic state along Marxist - Leninist lines . Beginning with the 1989 revolution , the legally recognized churches , especially the Romanian Orthodox Church , the country \u2019s largest religious group , pressured the post - communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools , offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals , elderly care homes and prisons .

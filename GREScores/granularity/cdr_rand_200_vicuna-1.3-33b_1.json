      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": {

      "Dose - dependent neurotoxicity of high - dose busulfan in children : a clinical and pharmacological study .|Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans , but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children .|We report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6 . 5 years ) receiving high - dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors , brain tumors excluded .|Busulfan was given p . o . , every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days .|Two total doses were consecutively used : 16 mg / kg , then 600 mg / m2 .|The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients ( 16 to 28 mg / kg ) .|Ninety - six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7 . 5 % ) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing .|When the total busulfan dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg / kg ( 1 of 57 , 1 . 7 % ) and patients under 600 mg / m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15 . 4 % ) ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .|Twenty - seven patients were given a 600 - mg / m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i . v .|infusion of clonazepam ; none had any neurological symptoms .|Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic - mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg / m2 busulfan with clonazepam : busulfan cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1 . 39 .|This was significantly different ( P less than 0 . 02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16 - mg / kg total dose of busulfan .|This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose - dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam .|A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased neurotoxicity , close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults .|Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16 - mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects .|The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .": {

      "Drug - induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors .|BACKGROUND : Drug - induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction .|Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose - dependent manner .|In the inpatient setting , the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug - drug interactions remain unknown .|METHODS : We performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 - year period in a tertiary care hospital .|A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone .|In addition to methadone dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation .|RESULTS : Among 167 methadone maintenance patients , the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0 . 50 second ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) or longer was 16 . 2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjects .|Six patients ( 3 . 6 % ) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes .|QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient , 0 . 20 ; P < . 01 ) .|Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31 . 8 % of QTc variability to methadone dose , cytochrome P - 450 3A4 drug - drug interactions , hypokalemia , and altered liver function .|CONCLUSIONS : QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding .|Methadone dose , presence of cytochrome P - 450 3A4 inhibitors , potassium level , and liver function contribute to QT prolongation .|Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone .": {

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": {

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": {

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": {

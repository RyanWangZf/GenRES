      "Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine - induced seizures .|Garcinielliptone FC ( GFC ) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart .|It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases .|However , there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents .|The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25 , 50 or 75 mg / kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid ( r - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine , aspartate and glutathione ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures .|GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure , at doses 25mg / kg ( 20 . 12 + 2 . 20 min ) , 50mg / kg ( 20 . 95 + 2 . 21 min ) or 75 mg / kg ( 23 . 43 + 1 . 99 min ) when compared with seized mice .|In addition , GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46 . 90 % when compared with seized mice .|In aspartate , glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5 . 21 % , 13 . 55 % and 21 . 80 % , respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice .|Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity ( 63 . 30 % ) when compared with seized mice .|The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus , as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals .|In conclusion , our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus .|This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent .": [

      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": [

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": [

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": [

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": [

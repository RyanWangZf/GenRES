      "Drug - induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors .|BACKGROUND : Drug - induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction .|Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose - dependent manner .|In the inpatient setting , the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug - drug interactions remain unknown .|METHODS : We performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 - year period in a tertiary care hospital .|A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone .|In addition to methadone dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation .|RESULTS : Among 167 methadone maintenance patients , the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0 . 50 second ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) or longer was 16 . 2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjects .|Six patients ( 3 . 6 % ) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes .|QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( Spearman rank correlation coefficient , 0 . 20 ; P < . 01 ) .|Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31 . 8 % of QTc variability to methadone dose , cytochrome P - 450 3A4 drug - drug interactions , hypokalemia , and altered liver function .|CONCLUSIONS : QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding .|Methadone dose , presence of cytochrome P - 450 3A4 inhibitors , potassium level , and liver function contribute to QT prolongation .|Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone .": [

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": [

      "Antimicrobial - induced mania ( antibiomania ) : a review of spontaneous reports .|The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic - induced manic episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic - induced mania .|Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .|Twenty - one reports of antimicrobial - induced mania were found in the literature .|There were 6 cases implicating clarithromycin , 13 implicating isoniazid , and 1 case each implicating erythromycin and amoxicillin .|The WHO reported 82 cases .|Of these , clarithromycin was implicated in 23 ( 27 . 6 % ) cases , ciprofloxacin in 12 ( 14 . 4 % ) cases , and ofloxacin in 10 ( 12 % ) cases .|Cotrimoxazole , metronidazole , and erythromycin were involved in 15 reported manic episodes .|Cases reported by the FDA showed clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin to be the most frequently associated with the development of mania .|Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken .|Patients have an increased risk of developing mania while being treated with antimicrobials .|Although this is not a statistically significant risk , physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility .|Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial - induced mania , the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial - induced manic episode among various demographic populations , and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode , which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics , subsides .|The authors elected to name this syndrome \" antibiomania . \"": [

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": [

      "The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .|BACKGROUND : In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .|In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .|METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2 % lidocaine or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h .|Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .|After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .|RESULTS : The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h .|However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .|Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX - 2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .|Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX - 2 , but not COX - 1 .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX - 2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .": [

      "Growth - associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide .|PURPOSE : GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting ( MFS ) in various experimental models of epilepsy .|To investigate how GAP43 expression ( GAP43 - ir ) correlates with MFS , we assessed the intensity ( densitometry ) and extension ( width ) of GAP43 - ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus ( IML ) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine ( Pilo ) , previously injected or not with cycloheximide ( CHX ) , which has been shown to inhibit MFS .|METHODS : CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats .|The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs , except for CHX .|Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later , and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry .|RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43 - ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX + Pilo , and control groups .|However , the results of the width of the GAP43 - ir band in the IML showed that CHX + Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0 . 03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .|CONCLUSIONS : Our current finding that animals in the CHX + Pilo group have a GAP43 - ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .|The change in GAP43 - ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP - 43 .": [

      "Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long - QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall .|BACKGROUND : This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .|The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium , midmyocardium , and endocardium were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ECG , in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations .|dl - Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .|Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0 . 1 to 10 micromol / L but shortened them at 30 micromol / L .|Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .|Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .|An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .|Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .": [

      "Depression , impulsiveness , sleep , and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) .|RATIONALE : Ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse .|Unfortunately , the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent .|OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT - related behaviors ; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years , and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances .|METHODS : A sample of 997 participants ( 52 % male ) was recruited to four control groups ( non - drug ( ND ) , alcohol / nicotine ( AN ) , cannabis / alcohol / nicotine ( CAN ) , non - ecstasy polydrug ( PD ) ) , and two ecstasy polydrug groups ( present ( MDMA ) and past users ( EX - MDMA ) .|Participants completed a drug history questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised which , in total , provided 13 psychometric measures .|RESULTS : While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non - drug controls , the MDMA and EX - MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures .|Strikingly , despite prolonged abstinence ( mean , 4 . 98 ; range , 4 - 9 years ) , past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery .|Compared with present ecstasy users , the past users showed no change for ten measures , increased impairment for two measures , and improvement on just one measure .|CONCLUSIONS : Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression , impulsiveness , and sleep disturbance , the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern .": [

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": [

      "Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users .|INTRODUCTION : The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction .|The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Three groups , comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( CN ) , 30 occasional cocaine ( OC ) , and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( RC ) users , were compared .|An emotional facial expression ( EFE ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surprise , sadness , anger , fear , and disgust ) was administered .|Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived .|Participants were also assessed with the \" Eyes task \" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList - 90 - Revised to measure psychopathology .|RESULTS : There were no group differences in psychopathology or \" eyes task \" performance , but the RC group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group , exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups .|The RC group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surprise , more slowly than CN , but not OC participants .|The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust .|The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group can not be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine , or ecstasy , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired .|Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .": [

      "Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson 's disease .|OBJECTIVES : Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .|These symptoms may be due to ' sensitisation ' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state .|The levodopa - treated MPTP - lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients .|Here we compare the time course of levodopa - induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms .|METHODS : Marmosets were administered 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg s . c . ) for five days , resulting in stable parkinsonism .|Levodopa ( 15 mg / kg and benserazide , 3 . 75 mg / kg ) p . o .|b . i . d , was administered for 30 days .|Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability , dyskinesia and on - time ( motor fluctuations ) and neuropsychiatric - like behaviors on Day 0 ( prior to levodopa ) and on Days 1 , 7 , 13 , 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater , blind to the treatment day .|RESULTS : The neuropsychiatric - like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds .|As anticipated , animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa - induced motor fluctuations , dyskinesia and wearing - off , that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy .|In contrast , levodopa - induced neuropsychiatric - like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment .|CONCLUSIONS : The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy .": [

      "A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation in neurocritical care patients .|OBJECTIVE : Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations .|However , both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects .|The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol .|DESIGN : Multicenter , retrospective , propensity - matched cohort study .|SETTING : Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board - certified neurointensivists .|PATIENTS : Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1 : 1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics .|INTERVENTIONS : Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol .|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : A total of 342 patients ( 105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol ) were included in the analysis , with 190 matched ( 95 in each group ) by propensity score .|The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension ( mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg ) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 beats / min ) during sedative infusion .|No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched ( 30 % vs 30 % , p = 0 . 94 ) or matched cohorts ( 28 % vs 34 % , p = 0 . 35 ) could be found .|When analyzed separately , no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts .|CONCLUSIONS : Severe hypotension and bradycardia occur at similar prevalence in neurocritical care patients who receive dexmedetomidine or propofol .|Providers should similarly consider the likelihood of hypotension or bradycardia before starting either sedative .": [

      "Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol .|BACKGROUND : Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .|One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .|There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .|OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .|METHODS : This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .|Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .|The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .|RESULTS : We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97 . 2 % of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .|Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2 . 646 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 008 , 6 . 944 ; P = 0 . 048 ) .|Patients who received the 100 mg / m ( 2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11 . 494 ( 95 % CI = 4 . 149 , 32 . 258 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and OR = 3 . 219 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 228 , 8 . 439 ; P = 0 . 017 ) , respectively .|CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .|Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m ( 2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .": [

      "Toleration of high doses of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure : results from the ATLAS trial .|The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival .|BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .|The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high - compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .|METHODS : The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12 . 5 or 15 . 0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high - ( 35 . 0 or 32 . 5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5 . 0 or 2 . 5 mg OD ) groups .|Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .|We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .|RESULTS : Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4 . 2 % could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2 . 0 % ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2 . 3 % ) .|Doses in more than 90 % of randomized patients in the high - and low - dose groups were titrated to their assigned target , and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study .|Withdrawals occurred in 27 . 1 % of the high - and 30 . 7 % of the low - dose groups .|Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance ( blood pressure , < 120 mm Hg ; creatinine , > or = 132 . 6 micromol / L [ > or = 1 . 5 mg / dL ] ; age , > or = 70 years ; and patients with diabetes ) generally tolerated the high - dose strategy .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses , and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted .": [

      "Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .|BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms .|It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational .|OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , heart disease , venous thromboembolism , stroke , transient ischaemic attacks , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , endometrial cancer , gallbladder disease , cognitive function , dementia , fractures and quality of life .|SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases up to November 2004 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .|Relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched .|SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT ( oestrogens with or without progestogens ) versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .|DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Fifteen RCTs were included .|Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently .|They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes .|Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta - analysis for most outcomes .|MAIN RESULTS : All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials .|In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event ( after one year 's use ) , stroke ( after 3 years ) , breast cancer ( after 5 years ) and gallbladder disease .|Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .|Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .|Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .|Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .|No trials focussed specifically on younger women .|However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .|The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT ; their absolute risk remained very low .|AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .|We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .": [

      "Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation : practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia .|Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized , direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .|The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT .|The US FDA - recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg / kg / min ( reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients ) , adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs ) 1 . 5 - 3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds ) .|Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion , e . g .|heart failure , yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction , adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity .|Argatroban 0 . 5 - 1 . 2 microg / kg / min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs .|The FDA - recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg / kg / min ( 350 microg / kg initial bolus ) , adjusted to achieve activated clotting times ( ACTs ) of 300 - 450 sec .|For PCI , argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients ; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age , sex , race / ethnicity or obesity , and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibition .|Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio , and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban - to - warfarin transition should be followed .|Major bleeding with argatroban is 0 - 10 % in the non - interventional setting and 0 - 5 . 8 % periprocedurally .|Argatroban has no specific antidote , and if excessive anticoagulation occurs , argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced .|Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT , including in special populations and during PCI , may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT ( e . g . fewer thromboses ) or its treatment ( e . g . fewer argatroban medication errors ) .": [

      "Effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans .|BACKGROUND : In dogs , a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular ( LV ) systolic function and an increase in LV end - diastolic pressure .|This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans .|METHODS AND RESULTS : In 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years ) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain , we measured heart rate , systemic arterial pressure , LV pressure and its first derivative ( dP / dt ) , and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15 - minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n = 10 , control subjects ) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg / min ( n = 10 ) .|No variable changed with saline .|With cocaine , the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3 . 0 + / - 0 . 4 ( mean + / - SD ) mg / L , similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication .|Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate , LV dP / dt ( positive or negative ) , or LV end - diastolic volume , but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures , LV end - diastolic pressure , and LV end - systolic volume , as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction .|CONCLUSIONS : In humans , the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance .": [

      "Succimer chelation improves learning , attention , and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure .|BACKGROUND : There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels .|However , very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children , or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure .|OBJECTIVES : The present study was designed to answer these questions , using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer , a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning .|RESULTS : Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation , paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children .|Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning , attention , and arousal regulation , although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit .|In contrast , succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen .|CONCLUSIONS : These are the first data , to our knowledge , to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure .|These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children .|However , they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals .": [

      "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .|PURPOSE : Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .|DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .|Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .|The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .|Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect .|METHODS : Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i . v . ) preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i . p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .|After a 6 - week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrificed .|Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62 ( 6 ) : 865 - 872 , 1978 ) .|Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|RESULTS : The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9 . 6 - fold ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 - 21 . 0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .|The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1 . 6 to 2 . 8 ( mean 2 . 2 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 4 . 1 , P = 0 . 019 ) .|The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4 . 4 - fold reduction ( P < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 8 . 2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .|This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P = 0 . 345 ) .|CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .": [

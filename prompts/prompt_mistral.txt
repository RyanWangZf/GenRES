Given a patient note, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of triplets.
Provide [`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`]. The relationship is directed, so the order of entities in each triplet matters.

Example 1:
prompt: Penicillin is an antibiotic that treats bacterial infections. It was discovered by Alexander Fleming.
relations:
[["Penicillin", "is a type of", "antibiotic"], ["Penicillin", "treats", "bacterial infections"], ["Penicillin", "discovered by", "Alexander Fleming"]]

Example 2:
prompt: Metformin is commonly prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes. It helps by lowering glucose production in the liver and increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin.
relations:
[["Metformin", "is prescribed for", "managing type 2 diabetes"], ["Metformin", "helps by", "lowering glucose production in the liver"], ["Metformin", "increases", "body\'s sensitivity to insulin"]]

prompt: $TEXT$

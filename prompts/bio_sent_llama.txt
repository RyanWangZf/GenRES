Given a prompt, identify and list the relationships between entities within the text. 
Provide a list of triplets in the format [`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`]. The relationship is directed, so the order of entities in each triplet matters.
The output should only be a list of triplets ([[`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`], ...]) without any additional information. Do not explain how you extract them.

Example:
prompt: Penicillin is an antibiotic that treats bacterial infections. 
relations:
[["Penicillin", "is a type of", "antibiotic"], ["Penicillin", "treats", "bacterial infections"]]

prompt: $TEXT$
relations:

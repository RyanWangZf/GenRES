Given a prompt, identify and list the relationships between entities within the text. 
Extract relationships both within a single sentence (intra-sentence) and across multiple sentences (inter-sentence). 
Provide a list of triplets in the format [`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`]. The relationship is directed, so the order of entities in each triplet matters.

Given a prompt, identify and list the relationships between entities within the text. 
Provide a list of triplets in the format [`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`]. The relationship is directed, so the order of entities in each triplet matters.
The output should only be a list of triplets ([[`ENTITY 1`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `ENTITY 2`], ...]) without any additional information. Do not explain how you extract them.

Example:
prompt: The Great Barrier Reef has been severely affected by climate change, leading to coral bleaching.
relations:
[["Great Barrier Reef", "affected by", "climate change"], ["Climate change", "leads to", "coral bleaching"]]

prompt: $TEXT$
